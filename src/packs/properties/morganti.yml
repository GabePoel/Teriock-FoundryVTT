      description: >-
        <p><b>[[lookup name]]</b> items are black in color. They deal
        @L[Damage:Morganti]{morganti damage} and @L[Drain:Morganti]{drain}.
        People feel when they are near a [[lookup name style=lc]] item through
        an unnerving sense of existential fear that's beyond anything in their
        normal lives. People who have experienced this often say that their
        "soul was afraid". If a [[lookup name style=lc]] item is encased in
        @L[Property:Silver]{silver}, then this feeling is greatly reduced.</p>
