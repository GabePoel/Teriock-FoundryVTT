        <b>Legendary</b> items shape fate around them such that they and their
        users become the stuff of legends. What <i>exactly</i> this entails is
        not fully known. However, @L[Category:Abilities]{abilities} they
        @L[Property:Granting]{grant} are typically given with @L[Core:Fluency
        Bonus]{fluency} and sometimes other @L[Category:Abilities]{abilities}
        used through them are as well.
