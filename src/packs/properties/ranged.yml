        <p>Weapons with this property can hit targets at a distance. A weapon
        that can be used to make a Ranged attack has a range in parentheses
        after specifying if it requires @L[Property:Ammunition]{ammunition} or
        if is @L[Property:Thrown]{thrown}. The range lists two numbers. The
        first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the
        weapon's long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you
        have @L[Core:Disadvantage]{disadvantage} on the @L[Core:Attack
        Interaction]{attack roll}. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's
        long range.
