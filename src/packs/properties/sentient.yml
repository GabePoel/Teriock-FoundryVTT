      description: >-
        <p>A <b>[[lookup name style=lc]]</b> item has some form of conscious
        thought, feelings, and emotions. It can perceive and sense its user and
        @L[Category:Creatures]{creatures} that it hits, although it is not
        necessarily able to communicate with them. [[lookup name]] items are not
        necessarily intelligent, but they can be affected by @L[Category:Mental
        effects]{mental effects} and can choose to not follow their user's
        commands. Some [[lookup name style=lc]] items may have a personality,
        greater senses of their surroundings, and be able to act on their
        own.</p>
