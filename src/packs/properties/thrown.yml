        <p>Weapons with this property can hit targets at a distance. A weapon
        that can be used to make a [[lookup name style=lc]] attack has a range
        in parentheses after specifying if it requires
        @L[Property:Ammunition]{ammunition} or if is
        @L[Property:Thrown]{thrown}. The range lists two numbers. The first is
        the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's
        long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have
        @L[Core:Disadvantage]{disadvantage} on the @L[Core:Attack
        Interaction]{attack roll}. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's
        long range.</p>
