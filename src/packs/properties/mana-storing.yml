      description: >-
        <p>A <b>mana storing</b> item has some latent energy held within it that
        creatures can use to power their own @L[Category:Abilities]{abilities}.
        Mana storing items will always have a number N associated with them (1,
        by default, if no number is listed). This number refers to a "mana die"
        analogous to those that creatures have. It is always [[/roll 1d4]] (3
        MP), which means the item stores a maximum of N × 3 @L[Core:MP]{MP}. At
        dawn, if @L[Ability:Attune]{attuned} to the mana storing item, roll
        [[/roll d4]]. The item regains up to this much spent @L[Core:MP]{MP}. If
        dawn comes and nobody is @L[Ability:Attune]{attuned} to a [[lookup
        name]] item, it releases all @L[Core:MP]{MP} it had stored.</p>
