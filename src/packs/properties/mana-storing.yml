      description: >-
        <p>A <b>[[lookup name style=lc]]</b> item has some latent energy held
        within it that creatures can use to power their own
        @L[Category:Abilities]{abilities}. Mana storing items will always have a
        number N associated with them (1, by default, if no number is listed).
        This number refers to a "mana die" analogous to those that creatures
        have. It is always [[/roll 1d4]] (3 MP), which means the item stores a
        maximum of N × 3 @L[Core:MP]{MP}. At dawn, if
        @L[Ability:Attune]{attuned} to the [[lookup name style=lc]] item, roll
        [[/roll d4]]. The item regains up to this much spent @L[Core:MP]{MP}. If
        dawn comes and nobody is @L[Ability:Attune]{attuned} to a [[lookup
        name]] item, it releases all @L[Core:MP]{MP} it had stored.</p>
