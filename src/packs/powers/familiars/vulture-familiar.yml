          creatures]{undead type}. The @L[Core:Game Master]{GM} may adjust the

          @L[Tradecraft:Priest]{priest} @L[Core:Tradecrafts]{check} based on the
          severity of the effect being cleansed. If the check is successful, the
          effect is removed and the target is destroyed in a similar manner to
          an @L[Category:Undead creatures]{undead} target. The target pulls
          stones from the @L[Condition:Dead]{death bag} based on the severity of
          the effect being cleansed (see @L[Core:Game Master]{GM}).
