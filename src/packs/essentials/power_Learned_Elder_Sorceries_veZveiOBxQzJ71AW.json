This art is believed to have been first mastered by the dragons and taught to mortals in the elder days. As it is meddling with the raw \"stuff\" of the world, <a href=\"https://wiki.teriock.com/index.php/Core:Elder_Sorcery\" title=\"Core:Elder Sorcery\">Elder Sorcery</a> requires a great deal more preparation and mana to create and successfully cast than the common \"prefabricated\" spells. The first step is to learn <a href=\"https://wiki.teriock.com/index.php/Core:Elder_Sorcery_Words\" title=\"Core:Elder Sorcery Words\">Elder Sorcery words</a>, which are thought to be the ancient first names for things given by the dragons as the world was created. These words can be used to make sentences to create an effect.</p>",
