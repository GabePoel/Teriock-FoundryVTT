    <p>The true wonder seeker, these mages are the philosophers of the world,
    always seeking out more knowledge and more wisdom. The Storm Mage is a
    logician, a tactical intellectual who prefers to neutralize opponents rather
    than destroy them. Often cold, the Storm Mage is also tumultuous and crafty.
    If you are playing a Storm Mage, be curious, hungry for information, always
    in the clouds, tricky and clever, eluding rather than confronting.</p>
