  description: >-
    <p>The least martial of the warriors, their outlook on life is that of the
    combat medic, focusing on keeping others alive on the front lines. Paladins
    are often leaders, as their charismatic charm draws followers to them and
    everyone likes to have a healer on their side. Paladins see themselves as
    somewhat better than most others as they have magical powers that other
    warriors lack. Paladins usually have a strong guiding force in their life to
    help those in need and do what is right. If you are a Paladin be righteous,
    concerned for others, and take charge.</p>

          <p>[[lookup name]] is a ritual that allows you to call upon their
          deity for a @L[Keyword:Blessing]{blessing}. As part of this ritual,
          you make a sacrifice to your deity. You can decide exactly what this
          sacrifice entails. It may be @L[Core:Hit Points and Mana Points]{MP},
          @L[Core:Hit Points and Mana Points]{HP}, magical items, vows of
          service, or anything else that you and your @L[Core:Game Master]{GM}
          agree upon. Once the sacrifice is complete, your @L[Core:Game
          Master]{GM} determines the blessing your deity grants you.</p><div
          class="note"><b>Note:</b> Although a @L[Core:Short Rest]{short rest}
          is the standard amount of time it takes to perform this ritual, you
          may choose to spend more or less time on it. Your @L[Core:Game
          Master]{GM} will choose how your deity interprets this.</div><div
          class="note"><b>Note:</b> While some deities may be interested in a
          large sacrifice, others may be more interested in the intent behind
          it. Your [[lookup name]] ritual should be tailored towards what your
          deity values. You are free to request something specific in your
          sacrifice, but your deity may choose to grant you something
          else.</div><div class="note"><b>Note:</b> The
          @L[Keyword:Blessing]{blessing} granted by your deity may have flaws or
          unexpected consequences. It always counts as a

          Although this ability is @L[Category:Sustained abilities]{sustained},
          you do not need to re-execute [[lookup name]] to regain its effects if
