    <p>Honor-bound and honest to the core, Duelists are often judges and
    referees for duels as well as devoted warriors. Duelists prize the honor of
    their family above any sort of personal gain and thus strive for excellence
    in everything that they do. A true Duelist wins the battle before it has
    begun. Strategy and personal perfection are the Duelist's way. If you are a
    Duelist, be calm, focused, well spoken and confident in yourself.</p>

          <p>[[lookup name]] is done in collaboration with up to 1 other
          creature (although they do not need to have [[lookup name]]). It
          requires willing and active participation from all targets. As part of
          [[lookup name]], you must ask three questions about the alignment,
          motives, or intentions of the group. Each participant (including
          yourself) must individually answer these questions. The questions are
          asked one at a time, and each participant must answer before the next
          question is asked. If anyone refuses to answer truthfully, the
          [[lookup name]] fails and all participants are
