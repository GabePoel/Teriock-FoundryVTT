  description: >-
    <p>Wild and savage. They distrust magic of all kinds and put their faith in
    themselves before others. Always at the front of a battle, Berserkers love
    the sport of combat and don't like missile weapons. Not reliable as guards
    as they are too distracted and are rarely very intelligent. If you are a
    Berserker be larger than life, brash, not too bright and stupidly brave.</p>
