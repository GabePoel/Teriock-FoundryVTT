  description: >-
    <p>As precise and accurate as a well-crafted arrow, archers don't mess
    around. They prefer to keep their distance, as that is where they are the
    most effective, never letting anyone get too close to them. Archers are
    direct and focused and thus make the best guards. Ever vigilant, archers are
    always looking ahead as, if taken by surprise, they are easily killed. If
    you are playing an Archer be direct, and on target, sturdy and perhaps high
    strung, watchful of the future and of your back.</p>
