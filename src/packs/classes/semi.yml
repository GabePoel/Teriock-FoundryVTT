    <p>Semis are classes that fill tactical or support roles in combat. Some are
    very skilled in close combat and have a variety of skills to achieve their
    aim, and others are more suited to fighting at range. All are classes that
    combine well with either warriors or mages, making semis the most versatile
    class archetype.</p>
