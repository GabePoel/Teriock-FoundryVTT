      overview:
        base: >-
          <p>You construct a stationary altar no larger than 10 feet in any
          direction. The altar is @L[Property:Magelore]{magelore} and
          @L[Property:Mana Storing]{mana storing} (1). It does not immediately
          gain the stored @L[Core:Hit Points and Mana Points]{MP}, but any
          creature may @L[Ability:Pay Mana]{Pay Mana} to put half the paid
          @L[Core:Hit Points and Mana Points]{MP} (rounded down) into it. Any
          number of creatures may @L[Ability:Attune]{Attune} to the altar and
          anyone may use the altar's stored @L[Core:Hit Points and Mana
          Points]{MP} so long as they are @L[Ability:Attune]{attuned} to it. If
          the altar ever takes at least 50 @L[Core:Damage]{damage} within a
          single @L[Core:Rounds]{round}, it is @L[Property:Destroyed]{destroyed}
          and all @L[Core:Hit Points and Mana Points]{MP} stored in it
          dissipates.</p>
        proficient: >-
          <p>The altar is now @L[Property:Mana Storing]{mana storing} (1 +
          @L[Core:Proficiency Bonus]{P}). If you like, the altar is also
          @L[Property:Magelore]{magelore} and can be used as creatures'
          @L[Category:Hand delivery abilities]{hands} if they have
          @L[Ability:Staff Touch]{Staff Touch} and are
          @L[Ability:Attune]{attuned} to it.</p>
        fluent: >-
          <p>The altar is now @L[Property:Mana Storing]{mana storing} (1 +
          @L[Core:Fluency Bonus]{F}). If you like, you may also specify up to
          @L[Core:Fluency Bonus]{F} creatures while creating the altar. You can
          choose to have these creatures as the only ones able to be
          @L[Ability:Attune]{attuned} to the altar or the only ones that can't
          be.</p>
