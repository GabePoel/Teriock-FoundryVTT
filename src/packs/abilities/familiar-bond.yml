          <p>[[lookup name]] is a ritual that allows you to bond with an animal
          companion. As part of this ritual, you call an animal to you and it
          chooses whether or not to become your <b>familiar</b>. If it chooses
          to be your familiar, you and it are @L[Category:Spiritual
          effects]{spiritually} bonded. You can sense feelings and emotions from
          your familiar and speak to other animals of the same species. Your
          familiar can sense your feelings and emotions as well. You also gain
          an @L[Tradecraft:Animal Tamer]{animal tamer} @L[Core:Fluency
          Bonus]{fluency} for your familiar's species. This does not grant you
          @L[Core:Proficiency Bonus]{proficiency} with @L[Tradecraft:Animal
          Tamer]{animal tamer} in general. If your familiar is in combat with
          you, treat it as a @L[Core:Minions]{minion} under your command.</p>

          <p>You also gain an @L[Category:Abilities]{ability} chosen by the
          @L[Core:Game Master]{GM} when your familiar is within 100 feet of you.
          The @L[Category:Abilities]{ability} is something your familiar can do
          naturally, is symbolic of, or that is related to your relationship
