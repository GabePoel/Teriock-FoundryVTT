          <p>You remanifest at the start of your next turn as an angrier and
          more powerful @L[Category:Undead creatures]{undead} being, lashing out
          at whatever @L[Condition:Dead]{killed} you as well as anything else in
          your way. This resets all @L[Core:Hit Points and Mana Points]{HP},
          @L[Core:Hit Points and Mana Points]{MP}, and temporary effects that
          may be present on you. Every time you escalate, you move one step
          forward on the following track. For instance, if you were already a
          @L[Creature:Phantom]{phantom}, you would escalate into being a
          @L[Creature:Specter]{specter}.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.teriock.tables.RollTable.LHGwqGbefAfHR3so]</p><p>Most
          @L[Creature:Haunt]{haunts} do not escalate past
          @L[Creature:Wraith]{wraith}. But the @L[Core:Game Master]{GM} may rule
          that certain especially angry or powerful ones have additional
          @L[Category:Abilities]{abilities} or escalation steps. If you escalate
          while already fully escalated, you do not change @L[Category:Spectral
          undead creatures]{species} or gain additional
          @L[Category:Abilities]{abilities}, but you still become more
          aggressive, harder to solve, and reset all @L[Core:Hit Points and Mana
          Points]{HP}, @L[Core:Hit Points and Mana Points]{MP}, and temporary
          effects.</p>
