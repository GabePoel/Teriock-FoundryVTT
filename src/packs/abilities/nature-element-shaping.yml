          <p>You have immense control over @L[Category:Nature element
          abilities]{elemental nature} around you. Any time a @L[Category:Nature
          element abilities]{nature element ability} is executed within range,
          you and the creature that executed it may both make
          @L[Core:Presence]{UNP} @L[Core:Feat Interaction]{feat saves}. If you
          roll at least as high as the creature that executed the
          @L[Category:Nature element abilities]{ability}, you take control over
          it. This lets you choose a new valid target with its range determined
          from a point of your choosing within the area affected by [[lookup
          name]]. You may also choose to @L[Core:Heightening]{heighten} the
          @L[Category:Nature element abilities]{ability} up to
          @L[Core:Proficiency Bonus]{P} additional times, so long as you pay the
          additional @L[Core:Hit Points and Mana Points]{MP} to do so.
          Alternatively, you may choose to have the @L[Category:Nature element
          abilities]{ability} fizzle. If there was no creature that executed the
          @L[Category:Nature element abilities]{ability} or you were the one
          that did so, you take control over it without needing to make any
          @L[Core:Presence]{UNP} @L[Core:Feat Interaction]{feat save}. You also
          gain @L[Keyword:Limited]{Limited} @L[Ability:Command Elite]{Command
          Elite}.</p>
