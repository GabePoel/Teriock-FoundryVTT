          <p>When you use @L[Ability:Pact Middleman]{Pact Middleman}, you gain
          not only a percentage of the @L[Category:Contract effects]{contract},
          but also a complete copy of it. You may only have one
          @L[Category:Contract effects]{contract} copied at a time. When you
          take on a new @L[Category:Contract effects]{contract}, the flaws of
          the old one remain. However, they count as debts and take on a gold
          value that you can pay off. This amount of gold value is determined by
          your @L[Core:Game Master]{GM}.</p>
