          <p>You do not get to choose what @L[Category:Classes]{classes} you go.
          Instead, they are determined for you through some external force. If
          not otherwise specified by the @L[Core:Game Master]{GM}, this is
          determined randomly. However, you get your first
          @L[Category:Classes]{rank} at @L[Core:Leveling Up]{level 1} instead of
          @L[Core:Leveling Up]{level 6}. You are still @L[Core:Proficiency
          Bonus]{proficient} in the @L[Category:Abilities]{abilities} you get
          through this @L[Category:Classes]{rank}. This extra
          @L[Category:Classes]{rank} does not give you additional @L[Core:Hit
          Points and Mana Points]{hit dice}, @L[Core:Hit Points and Mana
          Points]{mana dice}, @L[Core:Hit Points and Mana Points]{HP}, or
          @L[Core:Hit Points and Mana Points]{MP}.</p><p>Once a
          @L[Category:Classes]{class} is determined, you stick with it for two
          @L[Category:Classes]{ranks}. After that, you will start learning a new
          @L[Category:Classes]{class} and stick with it for another two
          @L[Category:Classes]{ranks}. It is possible to get the same
          @L[Category:Classes]{class} for multiple sets of two
          @L[Category:Classes]{ranks}.</p><p>Every two
          @L[Category:Classes]{ranks}, you gain an additional @L[Category:Flaw
          abilities]{flaw} as well from the following
          list.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.teriock.tables.RollTable.Brnxz85nV5zWdqaQ
