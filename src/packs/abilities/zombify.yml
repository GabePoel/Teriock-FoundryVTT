          under your command, but is hostile to everyone other than you that is
          not @L[Category:Zombies]{another zombie}. The
          @L[Creature:Zombie]{zombie} keeps the @L[Core:Size]{SIZE} it had
          before, but loses all other traits and abilities. If the target was
          already @L[Category:Zombies]{some kind of zombie}, then it is
          reanimated as that type.</p>
