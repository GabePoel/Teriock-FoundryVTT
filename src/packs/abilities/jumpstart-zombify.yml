          <p>At the start of the target's next turn, they are reanimated as a
          @L[Creature:Zombie]{zombie}. It is not under your command, but is
          hostile to everyone but you. The @L[Creature:Zombie]{zombie} keeps the
          @L[Core:Size]{SIZE} it had before, but loses all other traits and
          abilities. If the target was already @L[Category:Zombies]{some kind of
          zombie}, then it is reanimated as that type.</p>
