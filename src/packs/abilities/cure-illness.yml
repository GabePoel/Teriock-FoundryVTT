          @L[Category:Disease effects]{disease or illness} from some creature.
          The @L[Core:GM]{GM} determines the difficulty based on the severity of
          the illness. The @L[Core:GM]{GM} may also require you to have access
          to specific ingredients or tools or put other conditions in place. If
          the illness is mental in nature, then [[lookup name]] acts as a
          @L[Category:Mental effects]{mental effect}.</p>

          <p>You are @L[Keyword:Adept]{adept} at [[lookup name]]. Before you
          make the check, you may spend 1 additional @L[Core:MP]{MP} to know the
          DC if it is less than your total level. You may also add your
          @L[Core:Proficiency Bonus]{proficiency bonus} to the
          @L[Tradecraft:Herbalist]{herbalist} check regardless of whether or not
          you are proficient in @L[Tradecraft:Herbalist]{herbalist}.</p>
