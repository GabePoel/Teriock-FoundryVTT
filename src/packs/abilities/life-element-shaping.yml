          <p>You have immense control over @L[Category:Life element
          abilities]{elemental life} around you. Any time a @L[Category:Life
          element abilities]{life element ability} is executed within range, you
          and the creature that executed it may both make @L[Core:Presence]{UNP}
          @L[Core:Feat Interaction]{feat saves}. If you roll at least as high as
          the creature that executed the @L[Category:Life element
          abilities]{ability}, you take control over it. This lets you choose a
          new valid target with its range determined from a point of your
          choosing within the area affected by [[lookup name]]. You may also
          choose to @L[Core:Heightening]{heighten} the @L[Category:Life element
          abilities]{ability} up to @L[Core:Proficiency Bonus]{P} additional
          times, so long as you pay the additional @L[Core:Hit Points and Mana
          Points]{MP} to do so. Alternatively, you may choose to have the
          @L[Category:Life element abilities]{ability} fizzle. If there was no
          creature that executed the @L[Category:Life element
          abilities]{ability} or you were the one that did so, you take control
          over it without needing to make any @L[Core:Presence]{UNP}
          @L[Core:Feat Interaction]{feat save}. You also gain
          @L[Keyword:Limited]{Limited} @L[Ability:Command Elite]{Command
          Elite}.</p>
