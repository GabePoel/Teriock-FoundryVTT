          <p>In addition to the custom rotator spells you create, you can learn
          @L[Category:Rotator spells]{spells} created by others. When you come
          across a fully created spell using only words you are @L[Core:Fluency
          Bonus]{fluent} in, can make a DC 12 + OP @L[Core:INT]{INT}
          @L[Core:Feat Interaction]{feat save} to attempt to learn it. If you
          succeed, you can add it to your rotator spell list. If you fail, you
          are @L[Keyword:Incapable]{incapable} of attempting to learn that spell
          again. The @L[Core:Game Master]{GM} may modify the DC based on the
          spell's complexity, your knowledge of the spell, any special training
          you receive, if the spell's creator is there to assist you, or for any
          other factors they see fit. You may also attempt to learn words that
          you come across as long as they are of elements you are
          @L[Core:Fluency Bonus]{fluent} in. The @L[Core:Game Master]{GM} may
          adjust the DC for these as they see fit as well, but the default is DC
          15 + OP @L[Core:Intelligence]{INT} @L[Core:Feat Interaction]{feat
          save}.</p>
