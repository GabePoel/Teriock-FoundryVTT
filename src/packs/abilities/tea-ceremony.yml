          Tea Ceremony is done in collaboration with up to 1 other creature
          (although they do not need to have Tea Ceremony). It requires willing
          and active participation from all targets. As part of Tea Ceremony,
          you must ask three questions about the alignment, motives, or
          intentions of the group. Each participant (including yourself) must
          individually answer these questions. The questions are asked one at a
          time, and each participant must answer before the next question is
          asked. If anyone refuses to answer truthfully, the Tea Ceremony fails
          and all participants are @L[Keyword:Vulnerable]{vulnerable} to
          @L[Drain:Mana]{mana drain} and @L[Drain:Mana]{mana drain} is
          @L[Keyword:Boosted]{boosted} against them for 24 hours. This occurs
          once everyone has answered the latest question or immediately if
          someone refuses to answer whatsoever. If the Tea Ceremony is
          successful, all participants are @L[Keyword:Resistance]{resistant} to
          @L[Drain:Mana]{mana drain} for 24 hours and suffer no negative effects
          of @L[Core:MP]{mana loss} other than @L[Condition:Dead]{death} and
          @L[Condition:Unconscious]{unconsciousness}. Tea Ceremony can only be
          performed once per @L[Core:Long Rest]{long rest}.<div
          class="note"><b>Note:</b> Tea Ceremony detects only whether the
          participants believe their answers to be true, not whether or not they
          are.</div><div class="note"><b>Note:</b> If an effect such as
          @L[Ability:Lie]{Lie} is used to deceive the Tea Ceremony, it continues
          as if the lie were true.</div>
