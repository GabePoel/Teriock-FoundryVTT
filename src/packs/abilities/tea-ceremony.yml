          <p>[[lookup name]] is done in collaboration with up to 1 other
          creature (although they do not need to have [[lookup name]]). It
          requires willing and active participation from all targets. As part of
          [[lookup name]], you must ask three questions about the alignment,
          motives, or intentions of the group. Each participant (including
          yourself) must individually answer these questions. The questions are
          asked one at a time, and each participant must answer before the next
          question is asked. If anyone refuses to answer truthfully, the
          [[lookup name]] fails and all participants are
          @L[Keyword:Vulnerable]{vulnerable} to @L[Drain:Mana]{mana drain} and
          @L[Drain:Mana]{mana drain} is @L[Keyword:Boosted]{boosted} against
          them for 24 hours. This occurs once everyone has answered the latest
          question or immediately if someone refuses to answer whatsoever. If
          the [[lookup name]] is successful, all participants are
          @L[Keyword:Resistance]{resistant} to @L[Drain:Mana]{mana drain} for 24
          hours and suffer no negative effects of @L[Core:MP]{mana loss} other
          than @L[Condition:Dead]{death} and
          @L[Condition:Unconscious]{unconsciousness}. [[lookup name]] can only
          be performed once per @L[Core:Long Rest]{long rest}.</p><div
          class="note"><b>Note:</b> [[lookup name]] detects only whether the
          participants believe their answers to be true, not whether or not they
          are.</div><div class="note"><b>Note:</b> If an effect such as
          @L[Ability:Lie]{Lie} is used to deceive the [[lookup name]], it
          continues as if the lie were true.</div>
