          <p>Negative effects tend to linger on you longer than they would
          otherwise. Effects placed on you by opponents have their duration
          doubled. Additionally, if you would roll some number of [[/roll d4]]s
          to end effects placed on you by opponents, you roll one less [[/roll
          d4]] than you would otherwise.</p>
