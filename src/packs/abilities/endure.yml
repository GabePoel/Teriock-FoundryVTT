        base: >-
          <p>You take the triggering @L[Core:Damage]{damage} as a
          @L[Damage:Hack]{limb hack} instead. All @L[Category:Damage
          types]{damage types} still apply. If the hit was critical, you instead
          take it as <i>two</i> @L[Damage:Hack]{limb hacks}. If you attempted to
          @L[Core:Block Interaction]{block} the triggering @L[Category:Attack
          abilities]{attack}, then a limb that @L[Keyword:Using]{used} whatever
          @L[Category:Items]{item} you @L[Core:Block Interaction]{blocked} with
          is the one that's @L[Damage:Hack]{hacked}. Otherwise, if the
          @L[Core:Damage]{damage} was dealt by a creature, they choose which
          limb is affected. If not, it is random. Only an
          un-@L[Damage:Hack]{hacked} limb can be used for this. If that's not
          possible, you take the @L[Core:Damage]{damage} normally.</p>
