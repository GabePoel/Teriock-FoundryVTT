          @L[Ability:Haunt Deescalation]{Haunt Deescalation}.</p><p>You are
          spiritually tied to a specific object, place, person or deed and have
          some "unresolved business" involving this. Until this business is
          "resolved", you cannot be truly killed. Instead of
          @L[Condition:Dead]{dying}, you escalate, dissipating into a spectral
          mist and remanifesting as a more threatening being at the point your
          [[lookup name style=lc]] originates from.</p><p>It is also possible
          for you to be "solved" if someone addresses whatever it is that is
          causing you to haunt. This typically involves making you come to terms
          with something and could be as simple as convincing you that you are
          dead and telling you how it happened. But it could also be providing
          some sort of justice or revenge or something much more arcane. The
          details differ from @L[Creature:Haunt]{haunt} to
          @L[Creature:Haunt]{haunt}, but there are often hints in the
          @L[Creature:Haunt]{haunt's} behavior and surroundings. </p><p>If a
          creature makes progress towards solving you, that reflects in your
          behavior. You may be less aggressive towards them, appear to be
          listening to what they say, or even deescalate.</p>

          <p>You remanifest at the start of your next turn as an angrier and
          more powerful @L[Category:Undead creatures]{undead} being, lashing out
          at whatever @L[Condition:Dead]{killed} you as well as anything else in
          your way. This resets all @L[Core:Hit Points and Mana Points]{HP},
          @L[Core:Hit Points and Mana Points]{MP}, and temporary effects that
          may be present on you. Every time you escalate, you move one step
          forward on the following track. For instance, if you were already a
          @L[Creature:Phantom]{phantom}, you would escalate into being a
          @L[Creature:Specter]{specter}.</p><p>@Embed[Compendium.teriock.tables.RollTable.LHGwqGbefAfHR3so]</p><p>Most
          @L[Creature:Haunt]{haunts} do not escalate past
          @L[Creature:Wraith]{wraith}. But the @L[Core:Game Master]{GM} may rule
          that certain especially angry or powerful ones have additional
          @L[Category:Abilities]{abilities} or escalation steps. If you escalate
          while already fully escalated, you do not change @L[Category:Spectral
          undead creatures]{species} or gain additional
          @L[Category:Abilities]{abilities}, but you still become more
          aggressive, harder to solve, and reset all @L[Core:Hit Points and Mana
          Points]{HP}, @L[Core:Hit Points and Mana Points]{MP}, and temporary
          effects.</p>
