          <p>You make a pact with some spirit, @L[Category:Elemental
          creatures]{elemental}, @L[Category:Demons]{demon},
          @L[Category:Outsider creatures]{outsider}, or other supernatural
          being. In doing this, you are free to offer some sort of vow or
          sacrifice to the entity in question, but you do not have to. If the
          entity is interested in making a pact with you, they will offer you
          one that you can choose to either accept or reject. If you accept, you
          gain the benefits of the pact, but you must also fulfill its terms and
          live with the consequences of your choice. If you reject the pact,
          then you may not attempt to make another pact for at least 24 hours.
          The entity that you rejected is aware that you have rejected their
          offer and may not offer you another pact. Rather, they have likely
          taken offense to your rejection and may seek to punish you for it.
          When the pact is offered, you may not ask any clarifying questions,
          and you must accept or reject the pact as it is offered.</p>
        proficient: >-
          <p>You may ask up to @L[Core:Proficiency Bonus]{P} yes or no questions
          about the pact before you make your decision. The entity will answer
          truthfully, but will not offer any additional information.</p>
        fluent: >-
          <p>You may now ask up to @L[Core:Fluency Bonus]{F} yes or no questions
          about the pact before you make your decision. In addition, you may ask
          one question to which you receive a more involved answer. The entity
          will answer this question truthfully.</p>
