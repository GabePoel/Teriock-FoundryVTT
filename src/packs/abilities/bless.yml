          @L[Ability:Divine Gift]{Divine Gift}. It follows the same rules as
          that ritual, but allows you to revise and strengthen that ritual's
          effects. Remind the @L[Core:Game Master]{GM} of the effects of your
          Divine Gift, as they determine the effects of this ritual. The
          improved @L[Ability:Divine Gift]{Divine Gift} still counts as a
