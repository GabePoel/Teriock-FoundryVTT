          <p>[[lookup name]] Self in a ritual that improves your
          @L[Ability:Divine Gift]{Divine Gift}. It follows the same rules as
          that ritual, but allows you to revise and strengthen that ritual's
          effects. Remind the @L[Core:Game Master]{GM} of the effects of your
          Divine Gift, as they determine the effects of this ritual. The
          improved @L[Ability:Divine Gift]{Divine Gift} still counts as a
          @L[Keyword:Blessing]{blessing}.</p><div class="note"><b>Note:</b> Keep
          track of your original @L[Ability:Divine Gift]{Divine Gift's} effects.
          If you loose or become @L[Keyword:Incapable]{incapable} of [[lookup
          name]] Self, your @L[Ability:Divine Gift]{Divine Gift} returns to the
          state it was in before. If you loose or become
          @L[Keyword:Incapable]{incapable} of @L[Ability:Divine Gift]{Divine
