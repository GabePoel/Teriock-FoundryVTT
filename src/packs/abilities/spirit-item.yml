          <p>You summon a @L[Property:Magic]{magical} item for the duration of
          this effect. The item is the same every time, but is unique to you.
          The @L[Category:Equipment]{type of item} is determined by the
          @L[Core:Game Master]{GM}. The item has @L[Core:Fluency Bonus]{F}
          number of @L[Category:Abilities]{abilities}. The @L[Core:Game
          Master]{GM} decides what these @L[Category:Abilities]{abilities} are
          based on your character's behavior, actions, and personal development.
          As you increase in @L[Core:Leveling Up]{LVL}, the item gets more and
          more detailed. The item uses 1 @L[Core:Presence]{presence
          tier}.</p><p>Upon summoning, the item appears in your hand (if you
          would hold it) and is instantly @L[Ability:Attune]{attuned} and
          equipped. You must be able to @L[Ability:Attune]{Attune} the item and
          be able to use it in order to summon it.</p><p>If the item is ever
          @L[Property:Shattered]{shattered}, you @L[Condition:Dead]{die}. If it
          is ever @L[Property:Destroyed]{destroyed}, you @L[Condition:Dead]{die}
          and your body is @L[Condition:Ruined]{ruined}.</p>
