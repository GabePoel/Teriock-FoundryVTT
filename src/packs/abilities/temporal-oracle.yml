          <p>You may imagine a question or image. This starts a train of thought
          that manifests as a @L[Keyword:Visions]{vision} relating to what you
          first imagined. There are limitations on how often you can do this and
          the strength of the answer you receive. Once per @L[Core:Short
          Rest]{short rest}, you may ask a question and get a
          @L[Keyword:Visions]{minor vision} in response. If you are at a place
          of great power or significance to the deity or entity you are asking,
          you will receive a @L[Keyword:Visions]{full vision} instead.</p>

          <p>Once per @L[Core:Long Rest]{long rest}, you may ask a question and
          get a @L[Keyword:Visions]{full vision} in response. If you are at a
          place of great power or significance to the deity or entity you are
          asking, you will receive a @L[Keyword:Visions]{greater vision}
          instead.</p>

          <p>Your @L[Core:Short Rest]{short rest} questions receive a
          @L[Keyword:Visions]{full vision} and your @L[Core:Long Rest]{long
          rest} questions receive a @L[Keyword:Visions]{greater vision}. If you
          are at a place of great power or significance to the deity or entity
          you are asking, your visions are made even more powerful at
          @L[Core:Game Master]{GM} discretion.</p>
