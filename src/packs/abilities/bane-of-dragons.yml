          <p>You are @L[Keyword:Immunity]{immune} to
          @L[Category:Dragons]{dragons}. If they see you, they have an odd
          supernatural sense that there is something off about you, but not any
          further details. This sense extends over larger distances as well,
          causing @L[Category:Dragons]{dragons} to be occasionally drawn near
          you and for you to have more encounters with them that you might
          otherwise. The details of this effect are determined by the
          @L[Core:Game Master]{GM}.</p>
