          <p>You have immense control over @L[Category:Necromancy element
          abilities]{elemental necromancy} around you. Any time a
          @L[Category:Necromancy element abilities]{necromancy element ability}
          is executed within range, you and the creature that executed it may
          both make @L[Core:Presence]{UNP} @L[Core:Feat Interaction]{feat
          saves}. If you roll at least as high as the creature that executed the
          @L[Category:Necromancy element abilities]{ability}, you take control
          over it. This lets you choose a new valid target with its range
          determined from a point of your choosing within the area affected by
          [[lookup name]]. You may also choose to @L[Core:Heightening]{heighten}
          the @L[Category:Necromancy element abilities]{ability} up to
          @L[Core:Proficiency Bonus]{P} additional times, so long as you pay the
          additional @L[Core:Hit Points and Mana Points]{MP} to do so.
          Alternatively, you may choose to have the @L[Category:Necromancy
          element abilities]{ability} fizzle. If there was no creature that
          executed the @L[Category:Necromancy element abilities]{ability} or you
          were the one that did so, you take control over it without needing to
          make any @L[Core:Presence]{UNP} @L[Core:Feat Interaction]{feat save}.
          You also gain @L[Keyword:Limited]{Limited} @L[Ability:Command
          Elite]{Command Elite}.</p>
