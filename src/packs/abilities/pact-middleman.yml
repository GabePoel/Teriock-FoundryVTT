          <p>You may facilitate the creation of other creature's
          @L[Ability:Spirit Pact]{Spirit Pacts}, @L[Ability:Divine Gift]{Divine
          Gifts}, or other supernatural @L[Category:Contract
          effects]{contracts}. If you do, you take a percentage of the power
          from this contract for yourself. In the process, you gain an
          @L[Category:Abilities]{ability} from that contract. You can choose the
          percentage of the contract's power you take, but these terms must be
          made available to all parties before the contract is made. You may
          gain 2 @L[Category:Abilities]{abilities} from [[lookup name]]. If you
          facilitate additional contracts in the future, you may swap an
          @L[Core:Abilities]{ability} for one from the new contract instead. You
          do not typically gain flaws from the contracts you facilitate, but the
          @L[Core:Game Master]{GM} may give them at their discretion. You are
          responsible for enforcing the terms of all contracts you mediate.</p>

          facilitated through [[lookup name]].</p>
