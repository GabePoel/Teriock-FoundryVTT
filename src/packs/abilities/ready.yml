          <p>You prepare to use an action that will occur outside your turn.
          Choose a @L[Category:Single action abilities]{single action} or
          @L[Category:Free action abilities]{free action ability} you can use,
          and designate a trigger. Your turn then ends. If the trigger you
          designated occurs before the start of your next turn, you can use the
          chosen @L[Category:Single action abilities]{ability} as a
          @L[Category:Reactive abilities]{reaction} (provided you still meet the
          requirements to use it).<br><br>If you have an @L[Core:Attack

          Interaction]{attacks} and your readied @L[Category:Single action
          abilities]{ability} is an @L[Category:Attack abilities]{attack
          ability}, your readied @L[Category:Single action abilities]{ability}
          takes the same @L[Core:Attack Penalty]{attack penalty} you had at the
          time you used [[lookup name]]. This is one of the few times the
          @L[Core:Attack Penalty]{attack penalty} applies when it's not your
