          <p>You can sense up to 60 feet around you even when you are
          @L[Condition:Blind]{blind}. This lets you detect @L[Category:Movement
          effects]{moving creatures}, but has no color nor depth. Even subtle
          movements like breathing are sufficient for this purpose. This does
          not detect any color nor depth, such as pictures or words on a
          page.</p>
