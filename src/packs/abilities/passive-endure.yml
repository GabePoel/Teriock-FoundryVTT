      overview:
        base: >-
          <p>Whenever you are hit by an @L[Category:Attack abilities]{attack}
          that would @L[Core:Damage]{damage} you, you take that
          @L[Core:Damage]{damage} as a @L[Damage:Hack]{limb hack} instead. All
          @L[Category:Damage types]{damage types} still apply. If the hit was
          critical, you instead take it as <i>two</i> @L[Damage:Hack]{limb
          hacks}. If you attempted to @L[Core:Block Interaction]{block} the
          triggering @L[Category:Attack abilities]{attack}, then a limb that
          @L[Keyword:Using]{used} whatever @L[Category:Items]{item} you
          @L[Core:Block Interaction]{blocked} with is the one that's
          @L[Damage:Hack]{hacked}. Otherwise, if the @L[Core:Damage]{damage} was
          dealt by a creature, they choose which limb is affected. If not, it is
          random. Only an un-@L[Damage:Hack]{hacked} limb can be used for this.
          If that's not possible, you take the @L[Core:Damage]{damage}
          normally.</p>
