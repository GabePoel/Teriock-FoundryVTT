          @L[Ability:Thunderbolt]{Thunderbolt}, you may target an additional
          creature or the same creature twice. Any costs you pay must be paid

          These incur @L[Core:Attack Interaction]{attack penalties} as though
          they were two separate @L[Category:Attack abilities]{attacks}.</p>
