          <p>When you @L[Condition:Down]{drop}, your body vanishes and you
          become a "@L[Property:Morganti]{morganti} filament". This is an
          imperceptible two-dimensional thread through space cutting any
          @L[Category:Creatures]{creature} that passes through it. Any being
          that passes through the filament takes [[/damage 1d20[lethal
          morganti]]] @L[Core:Damage]{damage} as well as a random limb
          @L[Damage:Hack]{hack} unless they are wearing
          @L[Property:Silver]{silver} @L[Category:Armor]{armor}.
          @L[Property:Silver]{Silver} doesn't get cut by the filament. Instead,
          it "reactivates" and immediately @L[Core:Healing]{fully heals} you
          upon hitting the filament.</p>
