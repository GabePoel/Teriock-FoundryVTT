      overview:
        base: >-
          Rather than acting now, you delay until a later time. The rest of your
          @L[Core:Turns]{turn} doesn't happen yet. Instead, you're removed from
          the initiative order. You can return to the initiative order at the
          end of any other creature's turn. This permanently changes your
          initiative to the new position. You can't use any @L[Category:Reaction
          abilities]{reaction abilities} until you return to the initiative
          order. If you Delay for an entire @L[Core:Rounds]{round} without
          returning to the initiative order, the actions from the delayed turn
          are lost, your initiative order doesn't change, and your next turn
          occurs at your original position in the initiative order.<br /><br
          />When you use Delay, any negative effects that normally occur at the
          start or end of your turn occur immediately when you use the delayed
          action. Any beneficial effects that would end at any point during your
          turn also end. The @L[Core:GM]{GM} might determine that other effects
          end when you use Delay as well. Essentially, you can't Delay to avoid
          negative consequences that would happen on your turn or to extend
          beneficial effects that would end on your turn.
