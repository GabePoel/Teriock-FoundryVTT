          <p>Rather than acting now, you [[lookup name style=lc]] until a later
          time. The rest of your @L[Core:Turns]{turn} doesn't happen yet.
          Instead, you're removed from the initiative order. You can return to
          the initiative order at the end of any other creature's turn. This
          permanently changes your initiative to the new position. You can't use
          any @L[Category:Reaction abilities]{reaction abilities} until you
          return to the initiative order. If you [[lookup name]] for an entire
          @L[Core:Rounds]{round} without returning to the initiative order, the
          actions from the [[lookup name style=lc]]ed turn are lost, your
          initiative order doesn't change, and your next turn occurs at your
          original position in the initiative order.<br /><br />When you use
          [[lookup name]], any negative effects that normally occur at the start
          or end of your turn occur immediately when you use the [[lookup name
          style=lc]]ed action. Any beneficial effects that would end at any
          point during your turn also end. The @L[Core:Game Master]{GM} might
          determine that other effects end when you use [[lookup name]] as well.
          Essentially, you can't [[lookup name]] to avoid negative consequences
          that would happen on your turn or to extend beneficial effects that
          would end on your turn.</p>
