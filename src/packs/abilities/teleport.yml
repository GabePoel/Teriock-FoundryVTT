          <p>Target creature is moved to a location you have studied within your
          level in miles. You can study locations by performing this ritual on
          an area you are in over the course of a @L[Core:Long Rest]{long rest}.
          This location must be a static part of the environment, not a moving
          location like a wagon or ship. If the location substantially changes
          beyond recognition, your ritual will fail to transport creatures
          there. You can only have 2 location studied at a time.</p>
