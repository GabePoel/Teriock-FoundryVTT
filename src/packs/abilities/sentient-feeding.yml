If 24 hours pass and you have not fed, you lose your your largest @L[Core:HP]{hit die} and @L[Core:MP]{mana die}. Your @L[Core:Hit Points and Mana Points]{HP} and @L[Core:Hit Points and Mana Points]{MP} maximums decrease by the value of those dice. For each additional 24 hours you go without feeding, you lose your next largest @L[Core:HP]{hit die} and @L[Core:MP]{mana die}. To restore lost @L[Core:HP]{hit dice} and @L[Core:MP]{mana dice}, you must feed more than normal. If you feed on at least 2 creatures within a 24 hour period, you restore 1 lost @L[Core:HP]{hit die} and @L[Core:MP]{mana die}.</p>"
