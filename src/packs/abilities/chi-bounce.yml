          <p>The @L[Category:Attack abilities]{attack} is redirected at the
          creature making it. If its original @L[Core:Attack Interaction]{attack
          roll} is sufficiently high to hit the creature making the
          @L[Category:Attack abilities]{attack}, then it hits them instead. 
          This may be used on @L[Keyword:UB]{UB} @L[Category:Attack
