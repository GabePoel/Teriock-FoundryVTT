          exist)">creatures</a> and @L[Category:Equipment]{objects} within the
          area of effect are @L[Condition:Hidden]{hidden} with a hidden DC of 10
          + @L[Core:Presence]{UNP} (your @L[Core:Presence]{UNP}, not theirs).
          This is a @L[Keyword:Illusionary]{minor illusion}. If a creature
          successfully @L[Ability:Disbelieve]{Disbelieves} it, then they can see
          everything that was @L[Condition:Hidden]{hidden} in this area.
          Creatures that become @L[Condition:Hidden]{hidden} by this effect can
          move freely within the area and remain @L[Condition:Hidden]{hidden} as
          long as they do not leave the area. If they leave the area, they are
          no longer @L[Condition:Hidden]{hidden} and they do not become
          @L[Condition:Hidden]{hidden} if they re-enter it. At the start of each
          of each @L[Core:Rounds]{round}, the @L[Core:Game Master]{GM} rolls
          [[/roll 1d100]]. On a 75 or higher, some unexpected additional random
          @L[Keyword:Illusionary]{illusion} occurs in the area as determined by
          the @L[Core:Game Master]{GM}.</p>
