        hit: >-
          <p>Target is infected with a disease that takes 10 minutes to
          manifest. During this time, the disease can be removed with
          @L[Ability:Cure Illness]{Cure Illness} and a DC 15
          @L[Tradecraft:Herbalist]{herbalist} check. Afterwards, it can only be
          removed with effects akin to @L[Ability:Exorcism]{Exorcism}. Once the
          disease is manifested, the target's spirit must follow directions you
          provide to it. You do not need to share any language with the target
          or their spirit. This is more akin to a "hive mind", where they
          implicitly understand you needs and directives.</p>
