          <p>You are @L[Keyword:Immunity]{immune} to @L[Category:Elves]{elves}.
          If they see you, they have an odd supernatural sense that there is
          something off about you, but not any further details. This sense
          extends over larger distances as well, causing
          @L[Category:Elves]{elves} to be occasionally drawn near you and for
          you to have more encounters with them that you might otherwise. The
          details of this effect are determined by the @L[Core:Game
          Master]{GM}.</p>
