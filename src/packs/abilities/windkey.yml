          <p>You create a spherical bubble that remains centered on you. You
          create a spherical bubble that remains centered on you. Stormy weather
          within it is calmed. Any @L[Core:Damage]{damage} it would deal is
          @L[Keyword:Deboosted]{deboosted} twice and it cannot
          @L[Category:Movement effects]{move} creatures or objects. Any wind
          from the weather blows roughly in the direction you desire. If a boat
          or other object with sails is within the range of this effect, it
          travels in the direction you choose. If multiple creatures are using
          [[lookup name]] to move objects in different directions, then these
          effects cancel each other out and the objects are not moved.</p>
