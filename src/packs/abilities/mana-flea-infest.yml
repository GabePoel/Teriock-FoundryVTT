          <p>You bury yourself into the body of the creature you're infesting.
          On your own, this does nothing. But if many creatures are infested in
          someone, they start taking negative consequences. For every 25
          creatures [[lookup name]]ed into the target, they lose 1 @L[Core:Hit
          Points and Mana Points]{mana die}. If they have no @L[Core:Hit Points
          and Mana Points]{mana dice} remaining, they become
          @L[Condition:Paralyzed]{paralyzed}. At that point, if 25 additional
          infestations occur, the target is dealt enough @L[Drain:Mana]{mana
          drain} to @L[Condition:Dead]{dead} kill them the next time they fall
          @L[Condition:Unconscious]{unconscious}. While infested in someone, you
          cannot be target by @L[Category:Attack abilities]{attacks}, but you
          are @L[Condition:Paralyzed]{paralyzed}.</p>
