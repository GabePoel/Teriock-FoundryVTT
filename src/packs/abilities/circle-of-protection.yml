          <p>You enchant an area no larger than 30 feet in any direction. This
          area is surrounded by a barrier of light that creatures cannot easily
          pass into or out of this area by any means, including
          @L[Category:Displacement effects]{displacement effects}. However,
          @L[Category:Ranged equipment]{items} can move in and out.
          @L[Category:Missile delivery abilities]{missile abilities} and other
          ones with a sufficiently large range can cross this barrier so long as
          their executor remains on one side and makes a @L[Core:Strength]{STR}
          @L[Core:Feat Interaction]{feat save}. A creature that's higher
          @L[Core:Leveling Up]{level} than you may pass across this barrier
          without issue. Any other creature may attempt to pass by making a
          @L[Tradecraft:Priest]{priest check} with a DC equal to the difference
          between @L[Core:Leveling Up]{your level} and theirs.</p>
        fluent: >-
          <p>You may select up to 2 × @L[Core:Fluency Bonus]{F} creatures that
          can pass through this barrier without issue. You may also select up to
          2 × @L[Core:Fluency Bonus]{F} creatures that cannot pass through this
          barrier at all.</p>
        proficient: >-
          <p>You may select up to 2 × @L[Core:Proficiency Bonus]{P} creatures
          that can pass through this barrier without issue. You may also select
          up to 2 × @L[Core:Proficiency Bonus]{P} creatures that cannot pass
          through this barrier at all.</p>
