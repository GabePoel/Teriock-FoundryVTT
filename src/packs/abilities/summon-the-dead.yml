          <p>If you have the body of the target in your possession, you can put
          the spirit back into its body such that it is no longer
          @L[Condition:Wisping]{wisping}. The body maintains all damage it had
          when it died.</p>
        proficient: >-
          <p>If the body is thoroughly damaged (such as if it's
          @L[Condition:Ruined]{ruined}) or missing entirely, you can expend some
          of your own life force to recreate the body from the spirit for
          additional @L[Core:Hit Points and Mana Points]{MP} and @L[Core:Hit
          Points and Mana Points]{HP}. The creature is still dead, but the body
          is now intact.</p>
