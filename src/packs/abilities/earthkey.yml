          <p>You create a spherical bubble that remains centered on you. You
          create a spherical bubble that remains centered on you. Dry weather on
          land is calmed within it. Any @L[Core:Damage]{damage} it would deal is
          @L[Keyword:Deboosted]{deboosted} twice and it cannot
          @L[Category:Movement effects]{move} creatures or objects. If an object
          with sails is within the range of this effect, it travels in the
          direction you choose. If multiple creatures are using [[lookup name]]
          to move objects in different directions, then these effects cancel
          each other out and the objects are not moved.</p>
