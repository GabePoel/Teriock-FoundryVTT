          <p>The next time you would pull from the @L[Core:Death Bag]{death
          bag}, you will pull twice with a total number of stones between the
          two pulls equal to the amount you would have pulled had you not used
          [[lookup name]]. You declare how many stones are in each group prior
          to pulling and then do both pulls from the @L[Core:Death Bag]{death
          bag}. The pulls are independent and you take the effects of both
          pulls. Add one black stone to the @L[Core:Death Bag]{death bag} prior
          to making each pull. You may not use [[lookup name]] if you would pull
          less than 3 stones from the @L[Core:Death Bag]{death bag}.</p>
