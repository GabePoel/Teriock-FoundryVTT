          feet. You can detect dead and undead creatures as well, but you cannot
          distinguish within or between them. They all smell like death. You
          also gain @L[Ability:Scent Seeing]{Scent Seeing}. You can not detect
          @L[Condition:Odorless]{odorless} creatures in this way.</p>
