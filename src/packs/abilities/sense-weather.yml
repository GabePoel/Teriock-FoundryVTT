          <p>You know what the natural weather will be like in the next 24 hours
          in your location (clear, rainy, snowy, and so on). You also predict
          the weather conditions, natural or not, for the next 1 hour. This only
          gives you the <i>type</i> of weather, not the exact intensity of it.
          However, you can tell if the intensity will be more or less severe
          than it is currently and broadly how much so (for example, "much
          hotter" or "a little more violent"). Finally, you know whether the
          weather at your location is natural or unnatural.</p>
