        <p>The @L[Condition:Snared]{snare} caused by this ability does not end
        on its own. It can be escaped by @L[Ability:Interact]{interacting} with
        the web making a DC 25 @L[Core:Strength]{STR} @L[Core:Feat
        Interaction]{feat save}. This can be done either by the creature that is
        @L[Condition:Snared]{snared} or by another that attempts to free them.
        The DC is reduced by 1 for every additional creature of
        @L[Core:Size]{SIZE} 1 or larger that is assisting the target.</p>
