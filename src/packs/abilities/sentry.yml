          you use @L[Ability:Brace]{Brace} as long as you remain stationary and
          while performing "guard duty". Whether or not something counts as
          "guard duty" is up to the discretion of the @L[Core:Game Master]{GM}.
          Being on the front lines in a normal @L[Core:Combat]{combat} encounter
          would not typically count, but some cases that might are as
          follows.</p><ul><li>Being a hired guard for a
          nobleman.</li><li>Keeping watch during a @L[Core:Long Rest]{long
