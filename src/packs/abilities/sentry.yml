          while performing "guard duty". Whether or not something counts as
          "guard duty" is up to the discretion of the @L[Core:Game Master]{GM}.
          Being on the front lines in a normal @L[Core:Combat]{combat} encounter
          would not typically count, but some cases that might are as
