          <p>If the target of this ritual is @L[Category:Undead

          @L[Category:Regeneration effects]{regeneration effects} and
          @L[Category:Reanimation effects]{reanimation effects} while this
          ritual is being cast. In addition, any @L[Category:Regeneration
          effects]{regeneration effects} or @L[Category:Reanimation
          effects]{reanimation effects} that target them during this time
          @L[Core:Fizzles]{fizzle}.</p><p>When this ritual is completed, make a
          @L[Tradecraft:Priest]{priest} @L[Core:Tradecrafts]{check} to see if
          the @L[Category:Undead creatures]{undead} target is destroyed. The
          check's DC is typically equal to the @L[Category:Creatures by
          BR]{battle rating} of the target's @L[Category:Undead
          creatures]{undead type}. The @L[Core:Game Master]{GM} may adjust the
          DC based on other factors as they see fit.</p>[[lookup name]] can also
          be used to cleanse effects other than being @L[Category:Undead
          creatures]{undead}. The @L[Core:Game Master]{GM} decides the DC of the
          @L[Tradecraft:Priest]{priest} @L[Core:Tradecrafts]{check} based on the
          severity of the effect being cleansed. If the check is successful, the
          effect is removed and the target is destroyed in a similar manner to
          an @L[Category:Undead creatures]{undead} target. The target pulls
          stones from the @L[Condition:Dead]{death bag} based on the severity of
          the effect being cleansed (see @L[Core:Game Master]{GM}).
