          speak their @L[Core:Elder Sorcery]{true name} as a part of this
          ritual's incantation. The @L[Core:Game Master]{GM} may also adjust the
          target's bonus up or down for other reasons at their discretion. If
          the target is aware that you are hunting them, they make their roll
