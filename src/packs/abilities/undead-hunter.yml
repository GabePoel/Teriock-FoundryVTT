          <p>The target adds their @L[Core:Fluency Bonus]{fluency bonus} to
          their @L[Core:Feat Interaction]{feat} roll against you in
          <i>addition</i> to any @L[Core:Presence]{UNP} bonuses (including
          @L[Core:Proficiency Bonus]{proficiency} and @L[Core:Fluency
          Bonus]{fluency}) that they may have. They do not get this bonus if you
          speak their @L[Core:Elder Sorcery]{true name} as a part of this
          ritual's incantation. The @L[Core:Game Master]{GM} may also adjust the
          target's bonus up or down for other reasons at their discretion. If
          the target is aware that you are hunting them, they make their roll
          with @L[Core:Advantage]{advantage}.</p><div class="note"><b>Note:</b>
          The only part of this ability that @L[Category:Duel modifying
