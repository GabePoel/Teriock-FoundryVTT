      overview:
        base: >-
          <p>[[lookup name]] is a ritual that allows you to call upon their
          deity for a @L[Keyword:Blessing]{blessing}. As part of this ritual,
          you make a sacrifice to your deity. You can decide exactly what this
          sacrifice entails. It may be @L[Core:Hit Points and Mana Points]{MP},
          @L[Core:Hit Points and Mana Points]{HP}, magical items, vows of
          service, or anything else that you and your @L[Core:Game Master]{GM}
          agree upon. Once the sacrifice is complete, your @L[Core:Game
          Master]{GM} determines the blessing your deity grants you.</p><div
          class="note"><b>Note:</b> Although a @L[Core:Short Rest]{short rest}
          is the standard amount of time it takes to perform this ritual, you
          may choose to spend more or less time on it. Your @L[Core:Game
          Master]{GM} will choose how your deity interprets this.</div><div
          class="note"><b>Note:</b> While some deities may be interested in a
          large sacrifice, others may be more interested in the intent behind
          it. Your [[lookup name]] ritual should be tailored towards what your
          deity values. You are free to request something specific in your
          sacrifice, but your deity may choose to grant you something
          else.</div><div class="note"><b>Note:</b> The
          @L[Keyword:Blessing]{blessing} granted by your deity may have flaws or
          unexpected consequences. It always counts as a
          @L[Keyword:Blessing]{blessing}.</div><div class="note"><b>Note:</b>
          Although this ability is @L[Category:Sustained abilities]{sustained},
          you do not need to re-execute [[lookup name]] to regain its effects if
          you temporarily become @L[Keyword:Incapable]{incapable} of it.</div>
