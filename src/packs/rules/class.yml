        <p>Fierce and brazen, these mages are always at war. The arms dealers of
        the world, their magic is completely focused on destruction and thus
        they seek to create bigger and better ways to blow things up.
        Passionate, wild and a bit chaotic, these mages like the mountains and
        underground spaces. If you are playing a Flame Mage be hot tempered,
        war-like, ready for battle, and consuming
        everything.</p><h2>Archetype</h2><p>Every mage class gets the following

        <p>The true healers of the world, they are committed to sustaining all
        life. The truly altruistic characters, Life Mages are known to enter
        battles on neither side, healing anyone and everyone who they can.
        Obsessed with keeping people alive and conquering death, Life Mages are
        not as righteous as the Paladin but much more humble and kind. Shying
        away from combat, they prefer to stand behind the troops, healing when
        needed. If you are playing a Life Mage be helpful, kind and loving,
        protective but committed to saving lives and fighting
        death.</p><h2>Archetype</h2><p>Every mage class gets the following

        <p>The enchanter of the woods, these wandering spell casters resemble
        Rangers in their wanderlust. More comfortable with animals than people,
        Nature Mages are always heading to the woods and keeping to themselves.
        Ever in defense of the land, Nature Mages are like environmentalists.
        Nature Mages are in tune with the world at all times. If you are playing

        <p>The true dealer of death, Necromancers are most at home in the
        cemetery digging up future minions. Shunned by most of society, these
        dark mages are not necessarily evil, they simply see death as full of
        potential energy while others see it as the end of life. Necromancers
        fear nothing, as they are always facing death. If you are playing a
        Necromancer be unafraid, kill without remorse and be interested in dead
        bodies, close to death yourself, almost in another

        <p>The true wonder seeker, these mages are the philosophers of the

        is a logician, a tactical intellectual who prefers to neutralize
        opponents rather than destroy them. Often cold, the Storm Mage is also
        tumultuous and crafty. If you are playing a Storm Mage, be curious,

        <p>As precise and accurate as a well-crafted arrow, archers don't mess
        around. They prefer to keep their distance, as that is where they are
        the most effective, never letting anyone get too close to them. Archers
        are direct and focused and thus make the best guards. Ever vigilant,
        archers are always looking ahead as, if taken by surprise, they are
        easily killed. If you are playing an Archer be direct, and on target,
        sturdy and perhaps high strung, watchful of the future and of your
        back.</p><h2>Archetype</h2><p>Every semi class gets the following

        <p>The shadiest of all the classes, Assassins see life as expendable and
        unimportant. Even their own life is trivial, someone will kill them
        sooner or later. That's life. Life is short and thus Assassins tend to
        get to the point quickly, literally. Some-what of a martial artist,
        there is something Zen about the Assassin's way, not unlike the
        @L[Class:Duelist]{Duelist} in that they have strong inner motivation,
        though care nothing for honor. Assassins try to increase hatred between
        people in the hopes of creating more job opportunities for themselves.
        If you're an Assassin, don't think twice about killing someone, care
        little for your own life and cut to the

        <p>Wild and savage. They distrust magic of all kinds and put their faith
        in themselves before others. Always at the front of a battle, Berserkers
        love the sport of combat and don't like missile weapons. Not reliable as
        guards as they are too distracted and are rarely very intelligent. If
        you are a Berserker be larger than life, brash, not too bright and
        stupidly brave.</p><h2>Archetype</h2><p>Every warrior class gets the

        <p>Honor-bound and honest to the core, Duelists are often judges and
        referees for duels as well as devoted warriors. Duelists prize the honor

        before it has begun. Strategy and personal perfection are the Duelist's
        way. If you are a Duelist, be calm, focused, well spoken and confident

        are the weapon masters, well-armored but relying on their swift,
        powerful attacks and powerful strength to destroy their enemy before
        they can counter attack. Knights are the real behemoths of the
        battlefield, leading troops into the fray and slaughtering all they can.

        <p>The least martial of the warriors, their outlook on life is that of
        the combat medic, focusing on keeping others alive on the front lines.
        Paladins are often leaders, as their charismatic charm draws followers
        to them and everyone likes to have a healer on their side. Paladins see
        themselves as somewhat better than most others as they have magical
        powers that other warriors lack. Paladins usually have a strong guiding
        force in their life to help those in need and do what is right. If you
        are a Paladin be righteous, concerned for others, and take
        charge.</p><h2>Archetype</h2><p>Every warrior class gets the following

        <p>Jaded and tough, these warriors act as if they have seen it all.
        Obviously they are not all seasoned warriors, but the training of a
        Veteran involves a great deal of time in battle, so even a first rank
        Veteran has seen more action than other first rank warriors. The
        strategy of the Veteran is to be an immovable wall, and hold the line.
        Veterans rely on defense in battle, always working to better ensure
        their protection, which is why they survive to be veterans. If you are a
        Veteran be jaded, unimpressed, hard, and
        pessimistic.</p><h2>Archetype</h2><p>Every warrior class gets the
