        is ever the only one remaining in a given duel, the duel ends and they

        <p><span class="condition-box" data-children>If a creature is
        <b>transformed</b> then they are in a different form than their original
        form. Transformations can have different levels of strength.

        </span></p>

        <dl><dt>Minor Transformation</dt>

        <dd>A minor transformation is a transformation that is not very strong
        and is usually temporary. It can be reverted with a @L[Ability:Treeform
        Ball]{Treeform Ball}, a @L[Ability:Force Revert]{Force Revert}, or with
        a @L[Ability:Self Revert]{Self Revert} (DC 6 @L[Core:INT]{INT}
        @L[Core:Feat Interaction]{feat save}). Minor transformations do not
        change creatures' @L[Core:Intelligence]{INT} nor maximum
        @L[Core:MP]{MP}. Minor transformations cannot be "layered". That is, if
        a creature is minorly transformed into one form, and then minorly
        transformed into another, reverting from the second form puts them back
        into their original state. They do not revert into the first form they
        transformed into.</dd>

        <dt>Full Transformation</dt>

        <dd>A full transformation is stronger than a minor transformation. It
        cannot be reverted with a @L[Ability:Treeform Ball]{Treeform Ball} or a
        @L[Ability:Force Revert]{Force Revert}. But it can be reverted with a
        @L[Ability:Self Revert]{Self Revert} (DC 12 @L[Core:INT]{INT}
        @L[Core:Feat Interaction]{feat save}). Full transformations change
        creatures' @L[Core:Intelligence]{INT} from that of their original form
        to the one they're transformed into at a rate of 1 per month. It takes
        the same amount of time to recover if reverted. A creature's maximum
        @L[Core:MP]{MP} does not change as a result of a full transformation
        until their @L[Core:Intelligence]{INT} has fully changed. Similarly to
        minor transformations, full transforms can't be layered on top of each
        other. However, a fully transformed creature can then be minorly
        transformed. If that minor transformation is reverted, the creature then
        returns to their <i>fully transformed</i> state.</dd>

        <dt>Greater Transformation</dt>

        <dd>A greater transformation is even stronger than a full
        transformation. It can be reverted with a @L[Ability:Self Revert]{Self
        Revert} (DC 18 @L[Core:INT]{INT} @L[Core:Feat Interaction]{feat save}).
        Greater transformations immediately change creature's
        @L[Core:Intelligence]{INT} and maximum @L[Core:MP]{MP} to that of
        whatever they're transformed into. The original
        @L[Core:Intelligence]{INT} and maximum @L[Core:MP]{MP} are instantly
        restored upon reverting from a greater transformation. As with minor and
        full transformations, greater transformations do not layer on top of
        each other. However, a full or minor transformation can be layered on
        top of a greater in the same way that a minor transformation can be
        layered on a full one.<span class="metadata" data-type="category"

        <b>allured</b> to another creature will do whatever they tell them to.
        They are totally loyal to that other creature and also
        @L[Condition:Bound]{bound} to them. This is a @L[Category:Control
        effects]{control effect}, but it is not forcing actions directly.
        Rather, an allured creature <i>wants</i> to take action is does so of
        their own volition. In a "regular" @L[Condition:Bound]{binding}, the
        creature is aware they are being @L[Category:Control
        effects]{controlled} and can attempt to thwart the confines of their
        tether. But an allured creature is <i>not</i> aware of the effect that's
        been placed on them. It is more akin to being insane, blurring reality
        and shaping it to what they <i>believe</i> to be true.
