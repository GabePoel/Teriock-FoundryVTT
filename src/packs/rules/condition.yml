        condition. If there is only one creature remaining, then they choose
        whether to return to the realm they were in prior to dueling or to the
        Material Realm.

        </p><p>Any Dueling creature may use @Ability[Leave Duel]{Leave Duel} to

        Ethereal beings cannot typically be interacted with nor sensed by
        material (non-ethereal) ones. The main except is that if an ethereal
        being passes within 5 feet of a material one, the material creature

        transparent. They cannot pass through material (non-ethereal) walls or
        objects. However, they also cannot push, pull, grab, nor interact with
        material objects in any way. It is as though the ethereal creature has
        no material strength whatsoever.
