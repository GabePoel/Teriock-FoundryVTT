        world around them that may be interacted with by @L[Category:Duel
        modifying effects]{duel modifying effects} or other
        @L[Category:Abilities]{abilities}. The term "in a duel" is often used to
        refer to a creature that is dueling. This does <i>not</i> mean that the
        "duel" must have been started by @L[Ability:Duel]{Duel}.

        </span></p><p>If a creature that is dueling becomes incapacitated then
        they are considered to have "lost" the duel. If a dueling creature
        incapacitates themselves, they are considered to have "forfeited" the
        duel which in turn also makes them count as "losing". If a dueling
        creature @L[Category:Attack abilities]{attacks} a creature that they are
        not dueling, that is also considered to be "forfeiting". If a creature
        is ever the only one remaining in a given duel, the duel ends and they
        are considered to have "won" the duel.

        </p><p>Duels typically have a "range" of 30 feet. This means that if any
        creature that is dueling @L[Ability:Move]{Moves} more than 30 feet away
        from any other creature that they are dueling with, they are considered
        to have "forfeited" the duel.

        </p><p>The dueling state is not visible in the Material Realm, but there
        is a very slight tether that can be seen in the
        @L[Condition:Ethereal]{Ethereal Realm}. There are no restrictions on
        what realm a duel can take place in, but all participants must be within
        the same realm. Any participant that leaves that realm is considered to
        have gone out of range and therefore "lost the duel".<span

        creature is <b>ethereal</b>, it is in the <b>Ethereal Realm</b>. This is
        the domain of spirits and does not take kindly to those with a physical
        form. Ethereal beings cannot typically be interacted with nor sensed by
        material (non-ethereal) ones. The main except is that if an ethereal
        being passes within 5 feet of a material one, the material creature
        feels a strange unnatural chill pass over them.

        </p><p>If a creature that's ethereal is not innately a spirit, then they
        still have a size and shape while ethereal, but it is blurry and
        transparent. They cannot pass through material (non-ethereal) walls or
        objects. However, they also cannot push, pull, grab, nor interact with
        material objects in any way. It is as though the ethereal creature has
        no material strength whatsoever.

        </p><p>If you go @L[Condition:Down]{down} while ethereal, you
        @L[Condition:Dead]{die}, become a @L[Condition:Wisping]{wisp} and your
        body dissipates. Any being that has a physical form and that isn't being
        kept ethereal by some effect will manifest back into the Material Realm
        at dawn. They remember what they experienced while ethereal, but the
        details and order of events is a little jumbled and hazy.

        @L[Ability:Force Revert]{Force Revert}. But it can be reverted with a
        @L[Ability:Self Revert]{Self Revert} (DC 12 @L[Core:INT]{INT}
        @L[Core:Feat Interaction]{feat save}). Full transformations change
        creatures' @L[Core:Intelligence]{INT} from that of their original form
        to the one they're transformed into at a rate of 1 per month. It takes
        the same amount of time to recover if reverted. A creature's maximum
        @L[Core:MP]{MP} does not change as a result of a full transformation
        until their @L[Core:Intelligence]{INT} has fully changed. Similarly to
        minor transformations, full transforms can't be layered on top of each
        other. However, a fully transformed creature can then be minorly
        transformed. If that minor transformation is reverted, the creature then
        returns to their <i>fully transformed</i> state. Creatures are not
        @L[Core:Proficiency Bonus]{proficient} in
        @L[Category:Abilities]{abilities} they gain from being fully
        transformed.</dd>

        <dt>Greater Transformation</dt>

        <dd>A greater transformation is even stronger than a full
        transformation. It can be reverted with a @L[Ability:Self Revert]{Self
        Revert} (DC 18 @L[Core:INT]{INT} @L[Core:Feat Interaction]{feat save}).
        Greater transformations immediately change creature's
        @L[Core:Intelligence]{INT} and maximum @L[Core:MP]{MP} to that of
        whatever they're transformed into. The original
        @L[Core:Intelligence]{INT} and maximum @L[Core:MP]{MP} are instantly
        restored upon reverting from a greater transformation. As with minor and
        full transformations, greater transformations do not layer on top of
        each other. However, a full or minor transformation can be layered on
        top of a greater in the same way that a minor transformation can be
        layered on a full one.<span class="metadata" data-type="category"
