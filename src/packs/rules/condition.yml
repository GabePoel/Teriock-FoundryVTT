        "won" the duel.</p><p>Duels typically have a "range" of 30 feet. This

        all participants must be within the same realm. Any participant that
        leaves that realm is considered to have gone out of range and therefore
        "lost the duel".</p>

        <p>If a creature is <b>ethereal</b>, it is in the <b>Ethereal Realm</b>.
        This is the domain of spirits and does not take kindly to those with a
        physical form. Ethereal beings cannot typically be interacted with nor
        sensed by material (non-ethereal) ones. The main exception is that if an
        ethereal being passes within 5 feet of a material one, the material
        creature feels a strange unnatural chill pass over them.</p><p>If a
        creature that's ethereal is not innately a spirit, then they still have
        a size and shape while ethereal, but it is blurry and transparent. They
        cannot pass through material (non-ethereal) walls or objects. However,
        they also cannot push, pull, grab, nor interact with material objects in
        any way. It is as though the ethereal creature has no material strength
        whatsoever.</p><p>If you go @L[Condition:Down]{down} while ethereal, you
        @L[Condition:Dead]{die}, become a @L[Condition:Wisping]{wisp} and your
        body dissipates. Any being that has a physical form and that isn't being
        kept ethereal by some effect will manifest back into the Material Realm
        at dawn. They remember what they experienced while ethereal, but the
        details and order of events is a little jumbled and hazy.</p><p>There is
        a slight whooshing sound like a gust of wind whenever a creature enters
        or exits the Ethereal Realm.</p>

        @L[Core:Intelligence]{INT} nor maximum @L[Core:Hit Points and Mana
        Points]{MP}. Minor transformations cannot be "layered". That is, if a
        creature is minorly transformed into one form, and then minorly
        transformed into another, reverting from the second form puts them back
        into their original state. They do not revert into the first form they
        transformed into. Creatures are not @L[Core:Proficiency
        Bonus]{proficient} in @L[Category:Abilities]{abilities} they gain from
        being minorly transformed.</dd><dt>Full Transformation</dt><dd>A full

        reverted with a @L[Ability:Treeform Ball]{Treeform Ball} or a
        @L[Ability:Force Revert]{Force Revert}. But it can be reverted with a
        @L[Ability:Self Revert]{Self Revert} (DC 12 @L[Core:INT]{INT}
        @L[Core:Feat Interaction]{feat save}). Full transformations change
        creatures' @L[Core:Intelligence]{INT} from that of their original form
        to the one they're transformed into at a rate of 1 per month. It takes
        the same amount of time to recover if reverted. A creature's maximum
        @L[Core:Hit Points and Mana Points]{MP} does not change as a result of a
        full transformation until their @L[Core:Intelligence]{INT} has fully
        changed. Similarly to minor transformations, full transforms can't be
        layered on top of each other. However, a fully transformed creature can
        then be minorly transformed. If that minor transformation is reverted,
        the creature then returns to their <i>fully transformed</i> state.
        Creatures are not @L[Core:Proficiency Bonus]{proficient} in
        @L[Category:Abilities]{abilities} they gain from being fully
        transformed.</dd><dt>Greater Transformation</dt><dd>A greater
        transformation is even stronger than a full transformation. It can be
        reverted with a @L[Ability:Self Revert]{Self Revert} (DC 18
        @L[Core:INT]{INT} @L[Core:Feat Interaction]{feat save}). Greater
        transformations immediately change creature's @L[Core:Intelligence]{INT}
        and maximum @L[Core:Hit Points and Mana Points]{MP} to that of whatever
        they're transformed into. The original @L[Core:Intelligence]{INT} and
        maximum @L[Core:Hit Points and Mana Points]{MP} are instantly restored
        upon reverting from a greater transformation. As with minor and full
        transformations, greater transformations do not layer on top of each
        other. However, a full or minor transformation can be layered on top of
        a greater in the same way that a minor transformation can be layered on
        a full one.</dd></dl>
