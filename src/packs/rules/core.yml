        href="https://www.teriock.com/">Teriock</a> Online, everything a
        creature can do is determined by its
        @Wiki[Category:Abilities]{abilities}. These may be granted by the
        creature's species type, their @Wiki[Category:Classes]{classes}, magic
        items they use, or other @Wiki[Category:Traits]{traits} of theirs. By
        default, every creature is able to use any @Wiki[Category:Basic
        abilities]{basic abilities} so long as they meet whatever conditions are
        specified for the given @Wiki[Category:Basic abilities]{basic ability}.

        </p><p>Regardless of where it comes from, each Ability has the same
        underlying structure.

        </p>



        <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="User">User</span></h2>

        <p>An Ability's User is simply the creature that is using the Ability.
        This is the same for all Abilities.

        </p>

        <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Target">Target</span></h2>

        <p><span class="core-box"></span>An ability's <b>target</b> type
        determines what kinds of things can be affected by the Ability. Some of
        the most common ones are listed here.

        </p>

        <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Creature">Creature</span></h4>

        <p><span class="core-box">Abilities with the Creature Target affect some
        sort of being. A "creature" doesn't necessarily have to be an animal, it
        may be an animated statue or a sentient plant. Check with your
        @Core[GM]{GM} if in doubt of whether something is a creature or
        not.</span>

        </p>

        <h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Limb">Limb</span></h5>

        <p><span class="core-box">Rather than hitting an entire creature, some
        Abilities will say that they only hit arms, legs, or limbs. If these
        Abilities are @Core[Attack Interaction]{attacks}, then they slightly
        harder to land a hit with than ones that can hit a creature anywhere.
        They require hitting that creature's @Core[Armor Class]{AC} + 2.</span>

        </p>

        <h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Vitals">Vitals</span></h5>

        <p><span class="core-box">Vitals Targeted Abilities need to hit a
        creature's head or other vital organs rather than landing anywhere. If
        these Abilities are @Core[Attack Interaction]{attacks}, then they
        require hitting a creature's @Core[Armor Class]{AC} + 3.</span>

        </p>

        <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Item">Item</span></h4>

        <p><span class="core-box">@Wiki[Category:Item target abilities]{Attacks
        that target items} need different @Core[Attack Interaction]{hit rolls}

        <ul><li>Wielded items (such as @Wiki[Category:Weapons]{weapons} or
        @Wiki[Category:Shields]{shields}): @Core[Armor Class]{AC} + 3 -
        @Core[Block Interaction]{BV}</li>

        <li>Large worn items (such as @Wiki[Category:Armor]{armor} or cloaks):
        @Core[Armor Class]{AC}</li>

        <li>@Wiki[Category:Small equipment]{Small} @Wiki[Category:Searchable
        equipment]{searchable items} (such as rings or amulets): @Core[Armor

        <p>If an @Wiki[Category:Item target abilities]{ability that targets an
        item} is successfully @Core[Block Interaction]{blocked}, it
        automatically hits the item that @Core[Block Interaction]{blocked} it.

        </p>

        <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Area">Area</span></h4>

        <p><span class="core-box">Abilities that Target an Area do not have a
        precisely defined size. Rather than affect a small, cohesive space such
        as a campsite, a room in a dungeon, or a small shack.These abilities may
        not have a Range specified.</span>

        </p>

        <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Self">Self</span></h4>

        </p>

        <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Ability">Ability</span></h4>

        <p><span class="core-box">Instead of targeting some person, place, or
        other physical thing, some @Wiki[Category:Abilities]{abilities} target
        other @Wiki[Category:Abilities]{abilities}. These include cases that
        target @Wiki[Category:Attack target abilities]{attack target abilities},
        @Wiki[Category:Conjured spells]{conjured} @Wiki[Category:Spell target
        abilities]{spells}, or other types of
        @Wiki[Category:Abilities]{abilities}.</span>

        </p>

        <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Other">Other</span></h4>

        <p><span class="core-box">Some Ability Targets don't fit nearly into one
        of the aforementioned categories. In these cases, the Ability's Target
        will just say "Other".</span>

        </p>

        <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Range">Range</span></h2>

        <p>Each Ability has some Range over which it can be used. These depend
        on the Delivery and Target.

        </p>

        <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Delivery">Delivery</span></h2>

        <p>Every Ability has one and <i>only one</i> @Wiki[Category:Delivery
        abilities]{delivery}. This always has at least two parts, a <a
        href="#Source">Source</a> and <a href="#Interaction">Interaction</a>.

        </p>

        <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Source">Source</span></h3>

        <p>The Source of an Ability's Delivery is the means by which it is
        transmitted from the User to the Target. There are many possible
        Sources, but the most common ones are as follows.

        </p>

        <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Item_2">Item</span></h4>

        <p><span class="core-box">Item Sourced Abilities are transmitted from
        the User to the Target via one of the User's items. Some Abilities may
        only specify "item" as the Source. Others may give a more specific
        description such as "weapon", "shield", or "armor". These are all
        considered to be Sourced with items and are just shorthands for the type
        of item that can be used.

        </span></p><p>The Range of Item Sourced Abilities is that of the item.

        </p>

        <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Missile">Missile</span></h4>

        <p><span class="core-box">Abilities with the missile source are those
        that would have spell stones in live action <a target="_blank"
        rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text"
        href="https://www.fanwar.com/">FanWar</a>. These are most often
        @Wiki[Category:Attack abilities]{attacks}, but do not have any physical
        weapon that mediates them. Instead, these Abilities may correspond to a
        ball of fire, a bolt of lightning, a gust of wind, or some other
        phenomenon. Missile @Wiki[Category:Attack abilities]{attacks} have
        @Core[Disadvantage]{disadvantage} on targets that have their executor
        within melee range. Missile sourced abilities also requite that the
        creature executing them have an open hand.

        </span></p>

        <div class="note"><b>Note:</b> A creature with @Ability[Staff
        Touch]{Staff Touch} wielding a @Wiki[Category:Magelore
        equipment]{magelore item} in their hand, counts as having that hand
        open.</div> 

        <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Sight">Sight</span></h4>

        <p><span class="core-box">Abilities sourced by <b>sight</b> do
        <i>not</i> require the user to literally see the target with their
        eyeballs. While that's still necessary in most cases, some creatures may
        have some sort of "@Wiki[Category:Sensory effects]{blindsight}" that
        allows them to "see" other creatures even when there's no light in the
        environment. Nevertheless, these abilities always require that the user
        have some sort of direct "visibility" of the target akin to seeing them
        directly. Regardless of how exactly the user sees the target, sight
        abilities can be used over some range that <i>may not</i> actually be as
        far as the user can see. For instance, @Ability[Duel]{Duel} operates by
        sight, but has a range of 30 feet even though the user may see the
        target from much further away.</span>

        </p>

        <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Aura">Aura</span></h4>

        <p><span class="core-box">Abilities with the <b>aura</b> delivery source
        are ones that could affect every target within some specified radius,
        centered on the @Core[Executer]{executer}. Unless specifically noted by
        the ability, the @Core[Executer]{executer} is not affected by
        @Wiki[Category:Aura delivery abilities]{aura abilities}.</span>

        </p>

        <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Hand">Hand</span></h4>

        <p><span class="core-box">Like with @Wiki[Category:Sight delivery
        abilities]{sight} and eyeballs, @Wiki[Category:Hand delivery
        abilities]{hand delivery sourced abilities} don't require the user to
        physically have a dexterous humanoid hand with recognizable fingers.
        Some creatures with claws, tentacles, or other appendages can use Hand
        Abilities without problem. However, something of this nature is always
        required. If a creature that typically has @Equipment[Hand]{literal
        hands} has their arms @Ability[Hack]{Hacked} or has their
        @Equipment[Hand]{hands} cut off, then they are unable to use
        @Wiki[Category:Hand delivery abilities]{hand delivered abilities}. It
        may be possible for them to find other ways to use these abilities in
        the future, but that's up to @Core[GM]{GM} discretion.

        </span></p><p>The range of @Wiki[Category:Hand delivery abilities]{hand
        delivery sourced abilities} is the reach of the
        @Core[Executer]{executer's} arm (or other appendage). This depends in
        part on the creature's @Wiki[Core:Size]{size}, but is usually 5 feet.

        </p>

        <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Bite">Bite</span></h4>

        <p><span class="core-box">Abilities with the @Wiki[Category:Bite
        delivery abilities]{bite delivery source} are similar to
        @Wiki[Category:Hand delivery abilities]{hand abilities}, but they are
        transmitted with something that at least <i>resembles</i> a
        @Equipment[Mouth]{mouth} rather than a @Equipment[Hand]{hand}.

        </span></p><p>The range of @Wiki[Category:Bite delivery abilities]{bite
        delivered abilities} is the reach of the @Core[Executer]{executer's}
        neck (or other similar body part). This depends in part on the
        creature's @Wiki[Core:Size]{size}, but is usually 5 feet.

        </p>

        <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Self_2">Self</span></h4>

        <p><span class="core-box"></span>Self Sourced Abilities are the simplest
        ones. They have no special means of transmission, but simply come from
        the User. This is sometimes used as a catch-all for Abilities that don't
        fit with any other Source.

        </p>

        <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Interaction">Interaction</span></h3>

        <p>In addition to a Source, every Ability is mediated by one of four
        @Core[Interactions]{interactions}. This determines what types of dice
        rolls, if any, need to be done for an Ability to affect its Target. See
        the @Core[Interactions]{interactions} page for complete detail.

        </p>

        <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Other_Delivery_Modifiers">Other
        Delivery Modifiers</span></h3>

        <p>Some Abilities are <i>always</i> @Keyword[AV0]{AV0} or
        @Keyword[UB]{UB}. When this is the case, it's mentioned within the
        Delivery.

        </p>

        <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Delivery_Packages">Delivery
        Packages</span></h3>

        <p><span class="core-box">Abilities may be listed as
        @Wiki[Category:Strike delivery abilities]{strikes},
        @Wiki[Category:Ritual delivery abilities]{rituals}, @Wiki[Category:Touch
        delivery abilities]{touches}, @Wiki[Category:Ball delivery
        abilities]{balls}, or @Wiki[Category:Ray delivery abilities]{rays}.
        These represent certain common deliveries composed out of the source and
        interaction primitives as well as other modifiers. What exactly these
        mean is listed in parentheses in the "delivery" section of relevant
        @Wiki[Category:Abilities]{abilities}.</span>

        </p>

        <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Execution_or_Casting_Time">Execution
        or Casting Time</span></h2>

        <p>Each Ability has a specified amount of "time" it takes to use. For
        @Wiki[Category:Spells]{spells} this is called the "Casting" time. For
        @Wiki[Category:Skills]{skills} and other
        @Wiki[Category:Abilities]{abilities} this is the "Execution" time. This
        is always paired with the type of @Core[Maneuvers]{maneuver} (written in
        parentheses) the Ability operates under.

        </p><p>Make sure to read the @Core[Maneuvers]{maneuvers} page for
        complete information.

        </p>

        <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Duration">Duration</span></h2>

        <p><span class="core-box">The <b>duration</b> of an
        @Wiki[Category:Abilities]{ability} is the <i>maximum</i> amount of time
        that that @Wiki[Category:Abilities]{ability's} effect applies for. Many
        abilities have an "end condition" that can apply before the full
        duration is reached. Other abilities have an "@Wiki[Category:Instant
        duration abilities]{instant}" duration which means the effect is simply
        applied at once. The duration of @Wiki[Category:Passive
        abilities]{passive abilities} describes the conditions under which
        they're in effect.</span>

        <p>Some Abilities are considered "effects" of various types. Effect

        attack <b>hits</b>. If the roll is less than the target's AC, the attack
        <b>misses</b>. A natural 20 on the die is always a hit, and a natural 1
        is always a miss. The consequence of a hit is described in the "On hit"
        section of the @Core[Abilities]{ability} that's used.

        <p><span class="core-box"></span>If an attack hits, but has not gone
        critical, then the defender has a chance to <b>block</b>. In addition to
        the @Core[Armor Class]{AV} of @Wiki[Category:Armor]{armor}, every
        @Wiki[Category:Equipment]{other item} has some <b>block value</b> (BV).
        If the defender attempts an @Core[Abilities]{ability} that uses the

        less than or equal to the attacker's attack roll, then the block fails.
        The consequence of a successful or unsuccessful block are described in
        the "On success" and "On fail" section of the @Wiki[Category:Block
        abilities]{ability} that's used. For a @Ability[Basic Block]{Basic

        <div class="note design-note"><b>Design Note:</b> I have many

        the human scale, and also allow creatures to be strong enough to carry
        their own bodies. It's actually a very limited set of values that that

        <div class="note design-note"><b>Design Note:</b> Why use pounds instead
        of sizes? Because I hate the size abstraction, somehow still have no

        means deals damage, considering all relevant modifiers in the process.
        Some @Wiki[Category:Abilities]{abilities} also deal <b>critical

      content: >-
        <p><span class="core-box">The <b>feat interaction</b> (or "feat save
        interaction") is used whenever a target would have the chance to respond
        to an @Core[Abilities]{ability} that doesn't hit them physically (such
        as area of effect abilities like @Wiki[Category:Aura delivery
        abilities]{auras}). Any @Core[Abilities]{ability} using the feat
        interaction has a "Saving feature" section which describes which
        @Wiki[Core:Attributes]{attribute} the target must use to make the save.
        They then add two times that @Wiki[Core:Attributes]{attribute}. For
        instance, if an ability requires a "feat of strength" to make the save,
        then the target will roll <span class="dice" data-full-roll="1d20"
        data-quick-roll="@1d20">[[/roll 1d20]]</span> + (2 ×
        @Wiki[Core:STR]{STR}). If they are @Core[Proficiency Bonus]{proficient}
        in the attribute they are saving with, they will add their
        @Core[Proficiency Bonus]{proficiency bonus} to the roll as well. If the
        roll is equal to or greater than the <b>save DC</b> then the save
        <b>succeeds</b>. If the roll is less than the save DC then the save
        <b>fails</b>. The consequence of a successful or unsuccessful save are
        described in the "On success" and "On fail" section of the
        @Core[Abilities]{ability} that's used. Some feats may also be able to
        "go critical" if the save is a natural 1.

        </span></p><p>The save DC depends on the creature using the
        @Core[Abilities]{ability}. If they're @Core[Proficiency
        Bonus]{proficient} in the ability, then the save DC is 10 +
        @Core[Proficiency Bonus]{P}. If not, then it's just 10.

        makes an <b>attack roll</b> (<span class="dice" data-full-roll="1d20"

        target's @Core[Armor Class]{AC} (typically 10 + @Wiki[Core:AV]{AV}), the
        attack <b>hits</b>. If the roll is less than the target's AC, the attack
        <b>misses</b>. A natural 20 on the die is always a hit, and a natural 1
        is always a miss. The consequence of a hit is described in the "On hit"
        section of the @Core[Abilities]{ability} that's used.

        </p><p>If the hit is from a natural 20, then the attack is a <b>critical
        hit</b> and the effect of the @Core[Abilities]{ability} "goes critical".
        If this changes anything about the effect, then it's described in the
        @Core[Abilities]{ability's} "On critical hit" section.

        Any creature that is @Condition[Up]{up} may choose to be hit by an
        attack, even if the attack would normally miss. This is called "Taking
        the hit". They cannot choose to take a critical hit.

        Interaction</span></h3>

        <p><span class="core-box">The <b>feat interaction</b> (or "feat save
        interaction") is used whenever a target would have the chance to respond
        to an @Core[Abilities]{ability} that doesn't hit them physically (such
        as area of effect abilities like @Wiki[Category:Aura delivery
        abilities]{auras}). Any @Core[Abilities]{ability} using the feat
        interaction has a "Saving feature" section which describes which
        @Wiki[Core:Attributes]{attribute} the target must use to make the save.
        They then add two times that @Wiki[Core:Attributes]{attribute}. For
        instance, if an ability requires a "feat of strength" to make the save,
        then the target will roll <span class="dice" data-full-roll="1d20"
        data-quick-roll="@1d20">[[/roll 1d20]]</span> + (2 ×
        @Wiki[Core:STR]{STR}). If they are @Core[Proficiency Bonus]{proficient}
        in the attribute they are saving with, they will add their
        @Core[Proficiency Bonus]{proficiency bonus} to the roll as well. If the
        roll is equal to or greater than the <b>save DC</b> then the save
        <b>succeeds</b>. If the roll is less than the save DC then the save
        <b>fails</b>. The consequence of a successful or unsuccessful save are
        described in the "On success" and "On fail" section of the
        @Core[Abilities]{ability} that's used. Some feats may also be able to
        "go critical" if the save is a natural 1.

        </span></p><p>The save DC depends on the creature using the
        @Core[Abilities]{ability}. If they're @Core[Proficiency
        Bonus]{proficient} in the ability, then the save DC is 10 +
        @Core[Proficiency Bonus]{P}. If not, then it's just 10.

        <p><span class="core-box"></span>A character's <b>presence tier</b> is a
        numerical indicator of their capacity to passively maintain their will
        over magical artifacts, spirits, or other beings. As they level up, a
        character's presence tier will continue to increase. Magic items,
        mounts, and the like will typically have the required tier it takes to
        use them specified. A character can only maintain control over things
        with a <i>total</i> tier less than or equal to their presence tier.
        Using something that requires presence takes
        @Ability[Attune]{Attunement}. @Ability[Deattune]{Deattunement} is
        required to free up presence for another purpose. Whenever <b><a
        class="mw-selflink selflink">PRES</a></b> is written, it refers to a
        character's <i>total</i> presence tier. <b><a class="mw-selflink
        selflink">UNP</a></b> is a character's <i>unused</i> presence.

        @Wiki[Category:Equipment]{equipment} that is no longer equipped, mounts
        that no longer with them, and so on.

        <p><span class="core-box"></span>Tradecrafts are used for <b>tradecraft
        checks</b>. These arise either when some rules text specifies (such as
        in @Ability[First Aid]{First Aid}), or when the @Core[GM]{GM} tells you
        to attempt one. When this happens, you roll <span class="dice"
        data-full-roll="1d20" data-quick-roll="@1d20">[[/roll 1d20]]</span> and,
        if proficient in the associated tradecraft, you add your
        @Core[Proficiency Bonus]{proficiency bonus} (P). You do <i>not</i> need
        to be proficient in a tradecraft to attempt a tradecraft check.

        <div class="note"><b>Note:</b> Tradecrafts have no levels associated
        with them. This differs from live action FanWar. You either have a given

        <p><span class="core-box"></span>As you rank up, you get the option to
        take additional tradecrafts, or gain a <b>fluency</b> in a tradecraft
        you already have. A tradecraft fluency is a more tailored form of the
        tradecraft it corresponds to. For instance, you could be a
        @Tradecraft[Historian]{historian} with a fluency in ancient Shaloban
        history, a @Tradecraft[Tailor]{tailor} with a fluency in wizard robes,
        or an @Tradecraft[Enforcer]{enforcer} with a fluency in intimidating
        homeless people. When you make a tradecraft check where your fluency is
        relevant, you add your @Core[Fluency Bonus]{fluency bonus} (F) instead
        of your @Core[Proficiency Bonus]{proficiency bonus} (P) to the roll. The
        @Core[GM]{GM} may also tailor the results of your check with regards to
        your fluency.
