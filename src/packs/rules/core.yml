        </p>

        <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Source">Source</span></h3>

        <p>The Source of an Ability's Delivery is the means by which it is
        transmitted from the User to the Target. There are many possible
        Sources, but the most common ones are as follows.

        </p>

        <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Item_2">Item</span></h4>

        <p><span class="core-box">Item Sourced Abilities are transmitted from
        the User to the Target via one of the User's items. Some Abilities may
        only specify "item" as the Source. Others may give a more specific
        description such as "weapon", "shield", or "armor". These are all
        considered to be Sourced with items and are just shorthands for the type
        of item that can be used.

        </span></p><p>The Range of Item Sourced Abilities is that of the
        item.<span class="metadata" data-type="category" data-category="Core

        </p>

        <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Missile">Missile</span></h4>

        <p><span class="core-box">Abilities with the missile source are those
        that would have spell stones in live action <a target="_blank"
        rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text"
        href="https://www.fanwar.com/">FanWar</a>. These are most often
        @L[Category:Attack abilities]{attacks}, but do not have any physical
        weapon that mediates them. Instead, these Abilities may correspond to a
        ball of fire, a bolt of lightning, a gust of wind, or some other
        phenomenon. Missile @L[Category:Attack abilities]{attacks} have
        @L[Core:Disadvantage]{disadvantage} on targets that have their executor
        within melee range. Missile sourced abilities also requite that the
        creature executing them have an open hand.

        </span></p>

        <div class="note"><b>Note:</b> A creature with @L[Ability:Staff
        Touch]{Staff Touch} wielding a @L[Category:Magelore equipment]{magelore
        item} in their hand, counts as having that hand open.</div> <p><span
        class="metadata" data-type="category" data-category="Core rules"></span>

        </p><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Sight">Sight</span></h4>

        <p><span class="core-box">Abilities sourced by <b>sight</b> do
        <i>not</i> require the user to literally see the target with their
        eyeballs. While that's still necessary in most cases, some creatures may
        have some sort of "@L[Category:Sensory effects]{blindsight}" that allows
        them to "see" other creatures even when there's no light in the
        environment. Nevertheless, these abilities always require that the user
        have some sort of direct "visibility" of the target akin to seeing them
        directly. Regardless of how exactly the user sees the target, sight
        abilities can be used over some range that <i>may not</i> actually be as
        far as the user can see. For instance, @L[Ability:Duel]{Duel} operates
        by sight, but has a range of 30 feet even though the user may see the
        target from much further away.<span class="metadata"
        data-type="category" data-category="Core rules"></span></span>

        </p>

        <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Aura">Aura</span></h4>

        <p><span class="core-box">Abilities with the <b>aura</b> delivery source
        are ones that could affect every target within some specified radius,
        centered on the @L[Core:Executer]{executer}. Unless specifically noted
        by the ability, the @L[Core:Executer]{executer} is not affected by
        @L[Category:Aura delivery abilities]{aura abilities}.<span
        class="metadata" data-type="category" data-category="Core
        rules"></span></span>

        </p>

        <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Hand">Hand</span></h4>

        <p><span class="core-box">Like with @L[Category:Sight delivery
        abilities]{sight} and eyeballs, @L[Category:Hand delivery
        abilities]{hand delivery sourced abilities} don't require the user to
        physically have a dexterous humanoid hand with recognizable fingers.
        Some creatures with claws, tentacles, or other appendages can use Hand
        Abilities without problem. However, something of this nature is always
        required. If a creature that typically has @L[Equipment:Hand]{literal
        hands} has their arms @L[Ability:Hack]{Hacked} or has their
        @L[Equipment:Hand]{hands} cut off, then they are unable to use
        @L[Category:Hand delivery abilities]{hand delivered abilities}. It may
        be possible for them to find other ways to use these abilities in the
        future, but that's up to @L[Core:GM]{GM} discretion.

        </span></p><p>The range of @L[Category:Hand delivery abilities]{hand
        delivery sourced abilities} is the reach of the
        @L[Core:Executer]{executer's} arm (or other appendage). This depends in
        part on the creature's @L[Core:Size]{size}, but is usually 5 feet.<span
        class="metadata" data-type="category" data-category="Core rules"></span>

        </p>

        <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Bite">Bite</span></h4>

        <p><span class="core-box">Abilities with the @L[Category:Bite delivery
        abilities]{bite delivery source} are similar to @L[Category:Hand
        delivery abilities]{hand abilities}, but they are transmitted with
        something that at least <i>resembles</i> a @L[Equipment:Mouth]{mouth}
        rather than a @L[Equipment:Hand]{hand}.

        </span></p><p>The range of @L[Category:Bite delivery abilities]{bite
        delivered abilities} is the reach of the @L[Core:Executer]{executer's}
        neck (or other similar body part). This depends in part on the
        creature's @L[Core:Size]{size}, but is usually 5 feet.<span
        class="metadata" data-type="category" data-category="Core rules"></span>

        </p>

        <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Self_2">Self</span></h4>

        <p><span class="core-box"><span class="metadata" data-type="category"
        data-category="Core rules"></span></span>Self Sourced Abilities are the
        simplest ones. They have no special means of transmission, but simply
        come from the User. This is sometimes used as a catch-all for Abilities
        that don't fit with any other Source.

        </p>

        <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Interaction">Interaction</span></h3>

        <p>In addition to a Source, every Ability is mediated by one of four
        @L[Core:Interactions]{interactions}. This determines what types of dice
        rolls, if any, need to be done for an Ability to affect its Target. See
        the @L[Core:Interactions]{interactions} page for complete detail.

        </p>

        <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Other_Delivery_Modifiers">Other
        Delivery Modifiers</span></h3>

        <p>Some Abilities are <i>always</i> @L[Keyword:AV0]{AV0} or
        @L[Keyword:UB]{UB}. When this is the case, it's mentioned within the
        Delivery.

        </p>

        <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Delivery_Packages">Delivery
        Packages</span></h3>

        <p><span class="core-box">Abilities may be listed as @L[Category:Strike

        the human scale, and also allow creatures to be strong enough to carry

        <p><span class="core-box"><span class="metadata" data-type="category"
        data-category="Core rules"></span></span><b>Elder Sorcery</b> is the raw
        "language" of creation used to create new @L[Category:Spells]{spells}
        and forms of magic. It is not purely a language in the strictest sense,
        but a generalized encapsulation of concepts and forms that can be
        represented through many different mediums of creative expression. It is
        most often expressed in verbal, written, or symbolic forms, but has also
        been cast as music, visual art, and even culinary arts. Anything spoken
        or otherwise cast in Elder Sorcery either is or becomes "true" in some
        sense.

        </p>



        <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Incantations">Incantations</span><span
        class="mw-editsection"></span></h2>

        <p>No matter how Elder Sorcery is being cast, it requires a mastery of
        the particular concepts that make up spell. These are referred to as
        "@L[Core:Elder Sorcery Words]{words}" and make up the fundamental pieces
        that spells are composed out of. The actual form of casting the spell,
        be it verbal, painted, brewed, or otherwise is akin to the "grammar"
        which strings these words together. The specific composition of words
        and grammar for a spell is referred to as its "incantation".

        </p>

        <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Role_of_Words">The Role of
        Words</span><span class="mw-editsection"></span></h3>

        <p>For instance, say a @L[Class:Nature Mage]{Nature Mage} wanted to
        create a spell that turns them and their allies into a animals. The
        words available to them for constructing the spell would be the words
        they knew through @L[Category:Abilities]{abilities} such as
        @L[Ability:Nature Elder Sorcery]{Nature Elder Sorcery}. These would be
        words from the @L[Core:Nature Elder Sorcery Words]{nature} and
        @L[Core:Celestial Elder Sorcery Words]{celestial} word lists. These
        words in turn are divided into an "order of power" (OP), which
        corresponds to the difficulty it takes to master the corresponding ideas
        in Elder Sorcery. The caster may want to speak the Elder Sorcery
        incantation "we transform into animals". But, if they only have access
        to OP 1 words, they might have to make do with "you me are this" and
        require an extra step of including the actual animal they want to turn
        into as part of the casting process. However, if they have access to OP
        6 words, they know the words to string together "we transform into
        animal". This is much closer to the ideal incantation, but still differs
        in that "animal" is singular. At this point, the spell's grammar becomes
        relevant. The Elder Sorcery words themselves cannot be freely pluralized
        and modified, but the medium of casting could provide context clues that
        suggest a meaning.

        </p>

        <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Role_of_Grammar">The Role of
        Grammar</span><span class="mw-editsection"></span></h3>

        <p>If the @L[Class:Nature Mage]{Nature Mage} is casting the spell using
        a dance, perhaps they put particular emphasis into the plurality of
        "we". If they are painting the spell on a canvas, whatever they use to
        represent the word "animal" could be depicted in such a way as to
        suggest plurality. However, if they are simply speaking the spell aloud,
        they might want to use the wording "we transform into many animal" to
        better convey the intended meaning. Or they could leave the incant as is
        and hope the meaning is still clear enough and that it doesn't just
        merge everyone together into a single animal.

        </p><p>Regardless of how the spell is cast, the words themselves remain
        constant. In painting a spell, the brush strokes or colors could be used
        to represent the words. In dancing, it could be particular movements or
        gestures. In cooking, it could be specific ingredients. In speaking, the
        words themselves can be spoken aloud. No matter how a spell is cast, the
        player doing so must actually do the incantation to the extent that is
        reasonable. So someone casting via art, should actually produce the art
        to do so. But if a spell involves ritual sacrifice, the @L[Core:Game
        Master]{GM} should not expect their player to actually kill a
        @L[Creature:Goat]{goat}. This difference in representation is the main
        pro and con of different grammars of casting. Speaking is relatively
        quick and easy, but may have unclear incantations or the risk of
        stumbling over words. Painting a spell could be time consuming, but it
        allows for more flexibility in putting words together and involves
        creating a physical object which may make for a more stable long-term
        effect.

        </p><p>An Elder Sorcerer does not automatically have every possible
        grammar available to them. Typically @L[Category:Mage classes]{mages}
        are taught spoken Elder Sorcery. These are spells that can be written
        down, but must be said aloud to be cast. A caster may specialize into
        some form of art or other grammar, but then that would be the medium
        they use to cast spells instead of speaking them. A caster will have
        immense difficulty using or interpreting a grammar that is unfamiliar to
        them. If someone casts a spell in their vicinity using known words but a
        foreign grammar, an Elder Sorcerer can still understand the wording that
        was used, even if they couldn't easily replicate the spell. Someone who
        does not know those words would still get a general sense of spell or
        the ideas behind it that they "feel" internally, but they would not be
        able to separate the distinct concepts of each Elder Sorcery word.

        </p>

        <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Creating_a_Spell">Creating a
        Spell</span><span class="mw-editsection"></span></h2>

        <p>Just because someone knows Elder Sorcery words, does not mean they
        can freely create any effect imaginable. A
        @L[Class:Necromancer]{Necromancer} cannot just say "I eradicate each
        city" and destroy every city in the world. Elder Sorcery spells need to
        be balanced like any other @L[Category:Abilities]{ability}. To this end,
        any player creating an Elder Sorcery spell should provide their
        @L[Core:Game Master]{GM} with the following:

        </p>

        <ol><li>The <b>incantation</b> for the spell which clearly shows which
        words are used and how they're implemented.</li>

        <li>The <b>intention</b> of the spell. This is the player's intended
        effect of the spell. And should include any flaws which might balance
        the spell out.</li>

        <li>A <b>casting cost</b> that must be paid every time the spell is
        used.</li>

        <li>A <b>creation cost</b> that must be paid when the spell is first
        made.</li></ol>

        <p>The @L[Core:Game Master]{GM} will take all these into account when
        deciding if the spell is appropriately balanced and has the freedom to
        reverse their decisions later if they think they made a mistake. Every
        spell must be created before it can be cast.

        </p>

        <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Maximum_Number_of_Words">Maximum
        Number of Words</span><span class="mw-editsection"></span></h3>

        <p>Just because a spell may be "balanced" in a mechanical sense does not
        mean that it can be created. After all, an archmage that's been casting
        for millennia should be better at creating spells than a
        @L[Core:Leveling Up]{level 11} @L[Class:Flame Mage]{Flame Mage}, even if
        their spells both use OP 1 words. This will manifest in several ways.
        The first in the number of words that be used in creating a spell. For
        the best chance of success, a character can only create words with 5
        <i>new</i> words or less. So the new @L[Class:Flame Mage]{Flame Mage}
        could cast "use this torch for warmth" to try and empower a torch to
        provide the warmth needed to survive a harsh polar night. But their next
        spell could be "use this torch to immediately burn you to ash" to make
        it so their torch immediately @L[Condition:Ruined]{ruins} any creature
        it touches. This spell is nine words long, but Elder Sorcery relies on
        the number of distinct concepts the caster can hold in their head at
        once. So, the second use of the word "to" doesn't count towards their
        limit. And since the words "use", "this", and "torch" were present in a
        spell they already made, they have practice with those ideas already and
        they don't count towards the limit wither. Thus the five new words are
        "to", "immediately", "burn", "you", and "ash". In this way each spell an
        Elder Sorcerer makes expands the dictionary of words they can work with.
        And if an Elder Sorcerer wants to create a long and complex spell in the
        future, they may want to make lots of smaller spells to build up to
        their ultimate vision. In addition to this scaling word maximum, the
        maximum <i>total</i> number of words cannot exceed the caster's total
        @L[Core:Leveling Up]{level}.

        </p>

        <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Prepared_Spells">Prepared
        Spells</span><span class="mw-editsection"></span></h3>

        <p>There is no theoretical limit to the number of a spells an Elder
        Sorcerer can know or create. However, a player can't just hand their
        @L[Core:Game Master]{GM} a list of 100 spells and expect to have them
        all available. The first limitation is that creating a spell typically
        takes at least a @L[Core:Long Rest]{long rest}. In addition, a caster
        that knows lots of spells doesn't have all of them available at once.
        Know Elder Sorcery spells count as "@L[Category:Rotator
        spells]{rotators}" for the purpose of prepared spell lists.

        </p>

        <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Spell_Creation_Rolls">Spell Creation
        Rolls</span><span class="mw-editsection"></span></h3>

        <p>Since creating and casting Elder Sorcery is working with raw magic
        itself, it caries substantial risks when compared to
        @L[Category:Conjured spells]{conjured} spells. Any time someone creates
        an Elder Sorcery spell, there is some chance of "fumbling". To determine
        if a spell fumbles, roll <span class="dice" data-full-roll="1d100"
        data-quick-roll="@1d100">[[/roll 1d100]]</span><span class="metadata"
        data-type="category" data-category="Dice template used"></span> four
        times, once for each of the following categories. For each category, the
        @L[Core:Game Master]{GM} rates the spell on a scale from 0 to 10, based
        on the answers to the corresponding questions.

        </p>

        <ol><li><b>Incantation</b>

        <dl><dd>How well does the incantation match the intention of the spell.
        Are there other interpretations that the incant could have? Is the
        intended meaning the most obvious meaning of the incant?</dd></dl></li>

        <li><b>Intention</b>

        <dl><dd>How doable is this intention in and of itself? Is it simple,
        clear, straightforward, and manageable? Or is it sprawling,
        far-reaching, vague, or metaphysically impossible?</dd></dl></li>

        <li><b>Creation Cost</b>

        <dl><dd>How appropriate is the creation cost for this spell? It must be
        at least 1 @L[Core:MP]{MP} per OP of <i>each</i> word in the spell plus
        triple whatever the casting cost of the spell is (see @L[Ability:Elder
        Sorcery Creation]{Elder Sorcery Creation}). If these criteria are met,
        the creation cost has a score of 8. Putting in more resources can push
        the creation cost up to 9 or 10. If this basic criteria is not met, the
        creation cost score is automatically 0. There is no downside to putting
        additional resources into the spell's creation cost when it comes to the
        spell creation roll itself. If it seems appropriate, the @L[Core:Game
        Master]{GM} may allow other players beyond just the spell's creator to
        put resources into the creation cost.</dd></dl></li>

        <li><b>Casting Cost</b>

        <dl><dd>How appropriate is the casting cost given the intention of the
        spell? If it seems perfect, then a score of 10 is possible. If spell is
        under-costed <i>or over-costed</i>, then the score goes
        down.</dd></dl></li></ol>

        <p>For each category, you will need to roll at least the corresponding
        "spell creation DC" on your <span class="dice" data-full-roll="1d100"
        data-quick-roll="@1d100">[[/roll 1d100]]</span><span class="metadata"
        data-type="category" data-category="Dice template used"></span> roll.
        The base DC is 25 + 10 * (10 - score) - @L[Core:Leveling Up]{LVL}.
        However, the @L[Core:Game Master]{GM} can choose to give bonuses or
        minuses for spell creation. These are categorized as a "experience
        bonus", an "assistance bonus", an "effort bonus", and a "metaphysics
        penalty". The experience bonus, is based on @L[Core:Proficiency
        Bonus]{proficiency} and @L[Core:Fluency Bonus]{fluency}. The assistance
        and effort bonuses have a maximum of +25. And the metaphysics penalty is
        typically negative and can take on any value. Some possible modifiers
        are outlined below.

        <p>Depending on the circumstance, the @L[Core:Game Master]{GM} can
        decide which, if any, of these or other modifiers are in place, whether
        they stack, or if these modifiers have a greater or lesser impact than
        the baseline numbers outlined above. If the character passes all their
        spell creation checks, then the spell is created and the character is
        free to rotate into it. If they fail at least one, then the spell
        fumbles. No matter the spell creation DC, the @L[Core:Leveling Up]{LVL}
        of the caster, and whatever modifiers are in place, there is
        <i>always</i> a chance of a fumble. Rolling a 1 or 2 always causes a
        fumble of some sort. A 2 could be a "minor fumble" but a 1 is always a
        "major fumble".

        </p>

        <h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Strain_Penalty">Strain
        Penalty</span><span class="mw-editsection"></span></h4>

        <p>If the @L[Core:Game Master]{GM} allows it, a character can attempt to
        create Elder Sorcery even if they don't meet all the rules and criteria
        outlined. This adds an optional "strain penalty" to the Elder Sorcery
        creation roll. A character could use more words than would typically be
        allowed, in which case -3 times the OP of <i>each</i> of the additional
        words should be added added to the strain penalty. The character could
        try and "snapcast" the spell and make it over a @L[Core:Short
        Rest]{short rest} instead of a @L[Core:Long Rest]{long rest}, in which
        case a -25 strain penalty is automatically added. Or they could try and
        improvise a spell during combat and have a -75 strain penalty applied.
        All strain penalties are optional rules that the @L[Core:Game
        Master]{GM} can decide whether they want to allow or not.

        </p>

        <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Fumbling">Fumbling</span><span
        class="mw-editsection"></span></h3>

        <p>If a spell fumbles, then it is not successfully created as intended.
        If all the spell creation rolls where within 25 of the spell creation
        DC, then the creation merely @L[Core:Fizzles]{fizzles}, whatever
        resources were put into creation are consumed, and no other costs apply.
        This is called a <b>minor fumble</b>.

        </p><p>If at least one of the spell creation rolls rolled more than 25
        below the creation DC, then this causes a <b>major fumble</b>. In such
        circumstances, the @L[Core:Game Master]{GM} decides on something novel
        that occurs based on which roll or rolls fumbled, the severity of the
        fumble, and the design of the spell. Since Elder Sorcery is a "language
        of truth", the @L[Core:Game Master]{GM} may think about the fumble
        through the framing of what was cast <i>instead</i> of the intended
        spell. Perhaps the spell casts early partway through the creation
        process and turns the caster into some mutated creature instead of the
        simple animal they intended. Maybe it summons some odd being the caster
        has to fight. Maybe the spell took more resources than intended and the
        caster was @L[Drain:Wither]{withered} to some degree. If there was
        immense @L[Core:MP]{MP} or other resources spent on the spell, some
        strange metaphysical phenomena could occur. Fumbles could leave lasting
        scars on casters or the world. Nevertheless, the @L[Core:Game
        Master]{GM} should consider what feels appropriate given the risk the
        player took in creating the spell and what would make for a fun game
        when deciding what happens. An unlucky roll on a well designed spell
        shouldn't permanently cripple a character and a poorly designed spell
        trying to destroy the universe shouldn't leave its caster unscathed.
        Oftentimes a fumble marks the beginning of a new adventure or challenge
        for the players to overcome.

        </p><p>If the @L[Core:Game Master]{GM} allows, a major fumble could
        result in a significantly modified spell that the character still gains
        and can rotate into. It might not do what they originally intended, but
        it could still be "interesting".

        </p><p>Even if an Elder Sorcery spell is successfully created, it can
        still fumble on casting. How this happens depends on the spell's
        grammar. In the case of spoken Elder Sorcery, this happens when the
        caster misspeaks while casting the spell. Each time a player casts a
        spell, they must recite its full incant. If they mess it up, this causes
        a fumble. Typically this is minor fumble. But if the mistake is
        particularly severe then the @L[Core:Game Master]{GM} may rule that a
        major fumble has occurred.

        </p>

        <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Learning_Spells">Learning
        Spells</span><span class="mw-editsection"></span></h2>

        <p>If a character stumbles upon a spell in the wild, they may be able to
        study and learn it more easily than if they are making a spell on their
        own. The spell's wording limitations still apply That is, the spell must
        not use more than five words that the caster studying the spell hasn't
        already created spells with. Learning spells don't unlock new words in
        this way. In addition, the baseline creation cost of three times the
        casting cost must still be paid. However, no spell creation rolls
        typically need to be made. If the @L[Core:Game Master]{GM} wants, they
        may attach some additional @L[Tradecraft:Metaphysics]{metaphysics} or
        other check to learning a new spell if its creator was substantially
        higher @L[Core:Leveling Up]{LVL} than the caster learning it, if it's in
        a foreign grammar, if it uses some archaic version of Elder Sorcery, or
        if its especially challenging in some other way. As with creating a
        spell, it takes a @L[Core:Long Rest]{long rest} to study one.

        <div class="note design-note"><b>Design Note:</b> I'm open to getting
        rid of the Hit Dice healing limitation. It might be far too limiting.
        There might also be versions of it that are better. I do really want to
        make sure that <i>all</i> healing has restrictions on how much it can be
        done though. The main reason for the Hit Dice limit is that it was a
        clear, elegant, and blanket way to apply a restriction to all healing
        without having to rethink each individual source of it. But we might
        just move that direction anyways.</div>

        characters in Teriock Online have many <b>Hit Points</b> (HP) and
        <b>Mana Points</b> (MP). And as characters level up, they continue to
        gain more. Partway through every rank, characters gain a <b>hit die</b>
        and a <b>mana die</b>. The type of die (5 HP (<span class="dice"

        determines how much a character's maximum HP or MP increases by with
        each rank (3, 4, and 5 respectively). Which type of die is determined by
        the type of class (@L[Category:Warrior classes]{warrior},
        @L[Category:Semi classes]{semi}, or @L[Category:Mage classes]{mage})
        that the character is. Journeymen count as @L[Category:Semi
        classes]{semis} for this purpose. At @L[Core:Leveling Up]{level 1},
        characters have maximum HP and MP of 1 each. They get their first hit
        die and mana die at level 5 (both 6 HP (<span class="dice"

        </p><p>Hit dice (but not mana dice) can be expended for
        @L[Core:Healing]{healing} or during a @L[Core:Short Rest]{short rest}.

        <p><span class="core-box"><span class="metadata" data-type="category"
        data-category="Core rules"></span></span>The most important interaction
        is the <b>attack interaction</b>, which is used whenever a weapon, body
        part, or missile would come into contact with a target. The attacker
        first makes an <b>attack roll</b> (<span class="dice"
        data-full-roll="1d20" data-quick-roll="@1d20">[[/roll 1d20]]</span><span
        class="metadata" data-type="category" data-category="Dice template
        used"></span>) against the target's @L[Core:Armor Class]{armor class}
        (AC). If the attacker is @L[Core:Proficiency Bonus]{proficient} with the
        @L[Core:Abilities]{ability} they are using, they add their
        @L[Core:Proficiency Bonus]{proficiency bonus} (P) to the roll. If this
        roll is equal to or greater than the target's @L[Core:Armor Class]{AC}
        (typically 10 + @L[Core:AV]{AV}), the attack <b>hits</b>. If the roll is
        less than the target's AC, the attack <b>misses</b>. A natural 20 on the
        die is always a hit, and a natural 1 is always a miss. The consequence
        of a hit is described in the "On hit" section of the
        @L[Core:Abilities]{ability} that's used.

        </p><p>If the hit is from a natural 20, then the attack is a <b>critical
        hit</b> and the effect of the @L[Core:Abilities]{ability} "goes
        critical". If this changes anything about the effect, then it's
        described in the @L[Core:Abilities]{ability's} "On critical hit"
        section.

        Any creature that is @L[Condition:Up]{up} may choose to be hit by an
        attack, even if the attack would normally miss. This is called "Taking
        the hit". They cannot choose to take a critical hit.

        </p><p>Shields have special rules regarding if a creature can attack.

        Shields always have the @L[Property:Blocking]{blocking property}. But
        different types of shields have different rules that govern what can be
        used with them.

        Interaction</span></h3>

        <p><span class="core-box">The <b>feat interaction</b> (or "feat save
        interaction") is used whenever a target would have the chance to respond
        to an @L[Core:Abilities]{ability} that doesn't hit them physically (such
        as area of effect abilities like @L[Category:Aura delivery
        abilities]{auras}). Any @L[Core:Abilities]{ability} using the feat
        interaction has a "Saving feature" section which describes which
        @L[Core:Attributes]{attribute} the target must use to make the save.
        They then add two times that @L[Core:Attributes]{attribute}. For
        instance, if an ability requires a "feat of strength" to make the save,
        then the target will roll <span class="dice" data-full-roll="1d20"
        data-quick-roll="@1d20">[[/roll 1d20]]</span><span class="metadata"
        data-type="category" data-category="Dice template used"></span> + (2 ×
        @L[Core:STR]{STR}). If they are @L[Core:Proficiency Bonus]{proficient}
        in the attribute they are saving with, they will add their
        @L[Core:Proficiency Bonus]{proficiency bonus} to the roll as well. If
        the roll is equal to or greater than the <b>save DC</b> then the save
        <b>succeeds</b>. If the roll is less than the save DC then the save
        <b>fails</b>. The consequence of a successful or unsuccessful save are
        described in the "On success" and "On fail" section of the
        @L[Core:Abilities]{ability} that's used. Some feats may also be able to
        "go critical" if the save is a natural 1.

        </span></p><p>The save DC depends on the creature using the
        @L[Core:Abilities]{ability}. If they're @L[Core:Proficiency
        Bonus]{proficient} in the ability, then the save DC is 10 +
        @L[Core:Proficiency Bonus]{P}. If not, then it's just 10.<span

        <p>A short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, during
        which a creature does nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking,
        reading, and tending to wounds. Some @L[Category:Short rest

        rest" as their execution time. A creature may choose to do <i>one</i> of

        <p>A long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long,
        during which a creature sleeps or performs light activity: reading,
        talking, eating, or standing watch for no more than 2 hours. If the rest
        is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity—at least 1 hour of
        walking, fighting, casting spells, or similar adventuring activity—the
        creatures must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it.

        <div class="note design-note"><b>Design Note:</b> I have many
        spreadsheets of lame algebra to make sure the weight and carrying
        capacity scaling make physical sense (one has to scale on a power of 2
        and the other on a power of 3), fit with our intuitions of strength on
        the human scale, and also allow creatures to be strong enough to carry
        their own bodies. It's actually a very limited set of values that that
        works for.</div>

        <div class="note design-note"><b>Design Note:</b> Why use pounds instead
        of sizes? Because I hate the size abstraction, somehow still have no
        intuition for how many "sizes" of weight objects are, and it's also

        circumstances of your @L[Condition:Dead]{death} and have a shaky
        recollection of the 24 hours leading up to it. The first time you try
        and recall something from this time, you must make a DC 10
        @L[Core:Intelligence]{INT} @L[Core:Feat Interaction]{feat save}. On a
        success, you can recollect the vague outline of what you're trying to
        remember. On a failure, you are unable to recall anything. On a critical
        success, you actually do remember the details of what you're trying to
        remember. And on a critical failure, you have an inaccurate memory given
        to you by the @L[Core:Game Master]{GM}. You can only attempt this
        recollection once for any time you have forgotten. If you have multiple
        deaths with at least 1 black stone pulled and overlapping forgotten time
        frames, you can still only attempt this once.

        <p><span class="core-box">If you pull all 3 black stones from the <a
        class="mw-selflink selflink">death bag</a> then you "permanently die"
        (or "PD"). This is where the red stones come into play. The first time
        you PD, you have a chance to receive "divine intervention" (or "DI").
        This means some powerful supernatural being has intervened in the events
        of the world to spare you from your fate. So long as you pull at least 1
        red stone, you have a divine intervention of some sort. But the strength
        of the intervention varies by how many red stones you pull. Minor divine
        interventions may change very little about you, and major ones can give
        powerful new @L[Category:Abilities]{abilities} and obligations as
        determined by the @L[Core:Game Master]{GM}. The @L[Core:Game Master]{GM}
        will take into account the strength of your character's faith, their
        actions in life, the power of different divine beings in the area, and
        perhaps other aspects in determining what exactly your divine
        intervention is. You may not know everything about your divine
        intervention from the moment you are offered it, but will likely have
        some sense of what you're gaining and what may be expected of you. You
        can always turn down a divine intervention that you don't want to
        receive, but you may not have any other options. At @L[Core:Game
        Master]{GM} discretion, it is occasionally possible to get more than one
        offer of divine intervention at once as well as offers from deities you
        may not have a great history with in the past. An intervention may be
        from magnanimous deities you have strong ties to. Or it could be from
        one hoping to use you to gain power in this world. Interventions are not
        to be taken lightly.

        @L[Core:Long Rest]{long rest}, or other period of relative downtime.
        Nevertheless, you have immediately knowledge of what you pulled. This
        includes if you are about to permanently die. You are free to go out in
        a blaze of glory.

        <p><span class="core-box">If you pull all 3 black stones from the
        @L[Core:Death Bag]{death bag} then you "permanently die" (or "PD"). This
        is where the red stones come into play. The first time you PD, you have
        a chance to receive "divine intervention" (or "DI"). This means some
        powerful supernatural being has intervened in the events of the world to
        spare you from your fate. So long as you pull at least 1 red stone, you
        have a divine intervention of some sort. But the strength of the
        intervention varies by how many red stones you pull. Minor divine
        interventions may change very little about you, and major ones can give
        powerful new @L[Category:Abilities]{abilities} and obligations as
        determined by the @L[Core:Game Master]{GM}. The @L[Core:Game Master]{GM}
        will take into account the strength of your character's faith, their
        actions in life, the power of different divine beings in the area, and
        perhaps other aspects in determining what exactly your divine
        intervention is. You may not know everything about your divine
        intervention from the moment you are offered it, but will likely have
        some sense of what you're gaining and what may be expected of you. You
        can always turn down a divine intervention that you don't want to
        receive, but you may not have any other options. At @L[Core:Game
        Master]{GM} discretion, it is occasionally possible to get more than one
        offer of divine intervention at once as well as offers from deities you
        may not have a great history with in the past. An intervention may be
        from magnanimous deities you have strong ties to. Or it could be from
        one hoping to use you to gain power in this world. Interventions are not
        to be taken lightly.

        the human scale, and also allow creatures to be strong enough to carry
        their own bodies. It's actually a very limited set of values that that
        works for.</div>

        <div class="note design-note"><b>Design Note:</b> Why use pounds instead
        of sizes? Because I hate the size abstraction, somehow still have no

        <p>A creature's <b>base movement speed</b> determines the maximum amount

        conditions. It is determined by the creature's @L[Core:Movement]{MOV}
        attribute and is equal to 30 + (10 × @L[Core:Movement]{MOV}) in feet per
        action. A creature's base movement speed alone does not actually
        determine how far it can move in practice. Every creature has speeds for
        different types of movement, such as walking, leaping, swimming,
        climbing, and flying. The possible speed adjustments are double, normal,
        half, quarter, and none. Moving 5 feet at half speed uses 10 feet of
        movement, while moving 5 feet at double speed uses only 2.5 feet of
        movement. The following table summarizes the different movement speed
        adjustments.
