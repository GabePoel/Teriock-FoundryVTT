          <p>The next time you would pull from the @L[Core:Death Bag]{death
          bag}, you will pull twice with a total number of stones between the
          two pulls equal to the amount you would have pulled had you not used
          [[lookup name]]. You declare how many stones are in each group prior
          to pulling and then do both pulls from the @L[Core:Death Bag]{death
          bag}. The pulls are independent and you take the effects of both
          pulls. Add one black stone to the @L[Core:Death Bag]{death bag} prior
          to making each pull. You may not use [[lookup name]] if you would pull
          less than 3 stones from the @L[Core:Death Bag]{death bag}.</p>

    <p>Honor-bound and honest to the core, Duelists are often judges and
    referees for duels as well as devoted warriors. Duelists prize the honor of
    their family above any sort of personal gain and thus strive for excellence
    in everything that they do. A true Duelist wins the battle before it has
    begun. Strategy and personal perfection are the Duelist's way. If you are a
    Duelist, be calm, focused, well spoken and confident in yourself.</p>
