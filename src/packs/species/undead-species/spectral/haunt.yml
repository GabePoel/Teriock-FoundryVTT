          <p>Gain @L[Ability:Haunt Escalation]{Haunt Escalation} and
          @L[Ability:Haunt Deescalation]{Haunt Deescalation}.</p><p>You are
          spiritually tied to a specific object, place, person or deed and have
          some "unresolved business" involving this. Until this business is
          "resolved", you cannot be truly killed. Instead of
          @L[Condition:Dead]{dying}, you escalate, dissipating into a spectral
          mist and remanifesting as a more threatening being at the point your
          haunting originates from.</p><p>It is also possible for you to be
          "solved" if someone addresses whatever it is that is causing you to
          haunt. This typically involves making you come to terms with something
          and could be as simple as convincing you that you are dead and telling
          you how it happened. But it could also be providing some sort of
          justice or revenge or something much more arcane. The details differ
          from @L[Creature:Haunt]{haunt} to @L[Creature:Haunt]{haunt}, but there
          are often hints in the @L[Creature:Haunt]{haunt's} behavior and
          surroundings. </p><p>If a creature makes progress towards solving you,
          that reflects in your behavior. You may be less aggressive towards
          them, appear to be listening to what they say, or even deescalate.</p>
