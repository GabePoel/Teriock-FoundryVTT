          spiritually tied to a specific object, place, person or deed and have
          some "unresolved business" involving this. Until this business is
          "resolved", you cannot be truly killed. Instead of
          @L[Condition:Dead]{dying}, you escalate, dissipating into a spectral
          mist and remanifesting as a more threatening being at the point your
          [[lookup name style=lc]] originates from.</p><p>It is also possible
          for you to be "solved" if someone addresses whatever it is that is
          causing you to haunt. This typically involves making you come to terms
          with something and could be as simple as convincing you that you are
          dead and telling you how it happened. But it could also be providing
          some sort of justice or revenge or something much more arcane. The
          details differ from @L[Creature:Haunt]{haunt} to
          @L[Creature:Haunt]{haunt}, but there are often hints in the
          @L[Creature:Haunt]{haunt's} behavior and surroundings. </p><p>If a
          creature makes progress towards solving you, that reflects in your
          behavior. You may be less aggressive towards them, appear to be
          listening to what they say, or even deescalate.</p>
