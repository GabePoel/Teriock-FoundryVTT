    <p>@L[Category:Common animal creatures]{Common animals} (or Teriock animals)
    with the spirit and some of the form of a Teriock magic item embedded in it.
    Most (but not all) of them are items that had spirited prior to the Misting.
    The items must be present as a @L[Category:Body parts]{part} of the
    @L[Category:Animal creatures]{animal}. For example, @L[Creature:Yellow
    Crab]{yellow crabs} can have magic axes embedded in them. If defeated, a
    @L[Tradecraft:Hunter]{hunter} check can be used to harvest the item with a
    DC of 5 per @L[Core:Presence]{item tier}. It exists as a temporary item with
    powers that fade after 24 hours. Once the powers fade, the body part
    crumbles away.</p>
