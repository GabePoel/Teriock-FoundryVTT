    <p>The true glory seekers, Knights are chivalrous to a point but have none
    of the @L[Class:Duelist]{Duelist's} respect for battles. Knights are the
    weapon masters, well-armored but relying on their swift, powerful attacks
    and powerful strength to destroy their enemy before they can counter attack.
    Knights are the real behemoths of the battlefield, leading troops into the
    fray and slaughtering all they can. If you are a Knight be looking for
    glory, looking for the next powerful weapon.</p>
