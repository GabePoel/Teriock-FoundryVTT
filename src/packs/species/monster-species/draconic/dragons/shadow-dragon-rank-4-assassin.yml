  description: >-
    <p>The shadiest of all the classes, Assassins see life as expendable and
    unimportant. Even their own life is trivial, someone will kill them sooner
    or later. That's life. Life is short and thus Assassins tend to get to the
    point quickly, literally. Some-what of a martial artist, there is something
    Zen about the Assassin's way, not unlike the @L[Class:Duelist]{Duelist} in
    that they have strong inner motivation, though care nothing for honor.
    Assassins try to increase hatred between people in the hopes of creating
    more job opportunities for themselves. If you're an Assassin, don't think
    twice about killing someone, care little for your own life and cut to the
    chase!</p>
