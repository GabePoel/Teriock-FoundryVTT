  description: >-
    <p>The least martial of the warriors, their outlook on life is that of the
    combat medic, focusing on keeping others alive on the front lines. Paladins
    are often leaders, as their charismatic charm draws followers to them and
    everyone likes to have a healer on their side. Paladins see themselves as
    somewhat better than most others as they have magical powers that other
    warriors lack. Paladins usually have a strong guiding force in their life to
    help those in need and do what is right. If you are a Paladin be righteous,
    concerned for others, and take charge.</p>
