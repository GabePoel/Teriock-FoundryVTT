    <p>Jaded and tough, these warriors act as if they have seen it all.
    Obviously they are not all seasoned warriors, but the training of a Veteran
    involves a great deal of time in battle, so even a first rank Veteran has
    seen more action than other first rank warriors. The strategy of the Veteran
    is to be an immovable wall, and hold the line. Veterans rely on defense in
    battle, always working to better ensure their protection, which is why they
    survive to be veterans. If you are a Veteran be jaded, unimpressed, hard,
    and pessimistic.</p>
