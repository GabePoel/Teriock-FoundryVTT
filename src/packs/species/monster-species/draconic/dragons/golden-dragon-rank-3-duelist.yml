    <p>Honor-bound and honest to the core, Duelists are often judges and
    referees for duels as well as devoted warriors. Duelists prize the honor of
    their family above any sort of personal gain and thus strive for excellence
    in everything that they do. A true Duelist wins the battle before it has
    begun. Strategy and personal perfection are the Duelist's way. If you are a
    Duelist, be calm, focused, well spoken and confident in yourself.</p>
