    <p>Almost as shady as the @L[Class:Assassin]{Assassin}, a Thief is a bit
    more socially oriented and has a much greater care for her own life. Thieves
    are the flip side of the @L[Class:Duelist]{Duelist} and tend to follow laws
    and tell the truth only if it serves their purpose. Always trying to make a
    profit, thieves are the businessmen of the world and will cheat you without
    blinking an eyelash, that is their job. If you are playing a thief, lie and
    make up stories, be ever watchful for a chance to search or loot and look
    for the profit angle, never doing anything for free.</p>
