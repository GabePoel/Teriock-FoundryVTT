  description: >-
    <p>People of the sea, they are never very comfortable far from a large body
    of water. Corsairs are wanderers and like to be on the move. Corsairs tend
    to be humble in that they understand that nature is greater than they are
    and respect it for that. If you are an Corsair, crave water and sailing, go
    with the flow, keep on the move, and keep things ship shape.</p>
