          entity is interested in making a pact with you, they will offer you
          one that you can choose to either accept or reject. If you accept, you
          gain the benefits of the pact, but you must also fulfill its terms and
          live with the consequences of your choice. If you reject the pact,
          then you may not attempt to make another pact for at least 24 hours.
          The entity that you rejected is aware that you have rejected their
          offer and may not offer you another pact. Rather, they have likely
          taken offense to your rejection and may seek to punish you for it.
          When the pact is offered, you may not ask any clarifying questions,
          and you must accept or reject the pact as it is offered.</p>

    <p>The true dealer of death, Necromancers are most at home in the cemetery
    digging up future minions. Shunned by most of society, these dark mages are
    not necessarily evil, they simply see death as full of potential energy
    while others see it as the end of life. Necromancers fear nothing, as they
    are always facing death. If you are playing a Necromancer be unafraid, kill
    without remorse and be interested in dead bodies, close to death yourself,
    almost in another world.</p>
