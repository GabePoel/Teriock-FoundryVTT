  description: >-
    <p>The enchanter of the woods, these wandering spell casters resemble
    Rangers in their wanderlust. More comfortable with animals than people,
    Nature Mages are always heading to the woods and keeping to themselves. Ever
    in defense of the land, Nature Mages are like environmentalists. Nature
    Mages are in tune with the world at all times. If you are playing a Nature
    Mage be reclusive, avoiding people if you can, happy in nature and eager to
    leave any civilization.</p>
