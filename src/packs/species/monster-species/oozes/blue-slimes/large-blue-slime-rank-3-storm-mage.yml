    <p>The true wonder seeker, these mages are the philosophers of the world,
    always seeking out more knowledge and more wisdom. The Storm Mage is a
    logician, a tactical intellectual who prefers to neutralize opponents rather
    than destroy them. Often cold, the Storm Mage is also tumultuous and crafty.
    If you are playing a Storm Mage, be curious, hungry for information, always
    in the clouds, tricky and clever, eluding rather than confronting.</p>

          you receive, if the spell's creator is there to assist you, or for any
          other factors they see fit. You may also attempt to learn words that
          you come across as long as they are of elements you are
