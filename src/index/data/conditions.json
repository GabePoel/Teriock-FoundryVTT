It can be reverted with a @L[Ability:Treeform Ball]{Treeform Ball}, a @L[Ability:Force Revert]{Force Revert}, or with a @L[Ability:Self Revert]{Self Revert} (DC 6 @L[Core:INT]{INT} @L[Core:Feat Interaction]{feat save}). Minor transformations do not change creatures' @L[Core:Intelligence]{INT} nor maximum @L[Core:MP]{MP}. Minor transformations cannot be \"layered\". That is, if a creature is minorly transformed into one form, and then minorly transformed into another, reverting from the second form puts them back into their original state. They do not revert into the first form they transformed into. Creatures are not @L[Core:Proficiency Bonus]{proficient} in @L[Category:Abilities]{abilities} they gain from being minorly transformed.</dd>\n<dt>Full Transformation</dt>\n<dd>A full transformation is stronger than a minor transformation. It cannot be reverted with a @L[Ability:Treeform Ball]{Treeform Ball} or a @L[Ability:Force Revert]{Force Revert}. But it can be reverted with a @L[Ability:Self Revert]{Self Revert} (DC 12 @L[Core:INT]{INT} @L[Core:Feat Interaction]{feat save}). Full transformations change creatures' @L[Core:Intelligence]{INT} from that of their original form to the one they're transformed into at a rate of 1 per month. It takes the same amount of time to recover if reverted. A creature's maximum @L[Core:MP]{MP} does not change as a result of a full transformation until their @L[Core:Intelligence]{INT} has fully changed. Similarly to minor transformations, full transforms can't be layered on top of each other. However, a fully transformed creature can then be minorly transformed. If that minor transformation is reverted, the creature then returns to their <i>fully transformed</i> state. Creatures are not @L[Core:Proficiency Bonus]{proficient} in @L[Category:Abilities]{abilities} they gain from being fully transformed.</dd>\n<dt>Greater Transformation</dt>\n<dd>A greater transformation is even stronger than a full transformation. It can be reverted with a @L[Ability:Self Revert]{Self Revert} (DC 18 @L[Core:INT]{INT} @L[Core:Feat Interaction]{feat save}). Greater transformations immediately change creature's @L[Core:Intelligence]{INT} and maximum @L[Core:MP]{MP} to that of whatever they're transformed into. The original @L[Core:Intelligence]{INT} and maximum @L[Core:MP]{MP} are instantly restored upon reverting from a greater transformation. As with minor and full transformations, greater transformations do not layer on top of each other. However, a full or minor transformation can be layered on top of a greater in the same way that a minor transformation can be layered on a full one.</dd></dl>",
