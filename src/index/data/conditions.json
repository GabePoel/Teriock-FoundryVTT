Minor transformations do not change creatures' @L[Core:Intelligence]{INT} nor maximum @L[Core:MP]{MP}. Minor transformations cannot be \"layered\".

It cannot be reverted with a @L[Ability:Treeform Ball]{Treeform Ball} or a @L[Ability:Force Revert]{Force Revert}. But it can be reverted with a @L[Ability:Self Revert]{Self Revert} (DC 12 @L[Core:INT]{INT} @L[Core:Feat Interaction]{feat save}). Full transformations change creatures' @L[Core:Intelligence]{INT} from that of their original form to the one they're transformed into at a rate of 1 per month. It takes the same amount of time to recover if reverted. A creature's maximum @L[Core:MP]{MP} does not change as a result of a full transformation until their @L[Core:Intelligence]{INT} has fully changed. Similarly to minor transformations, full transforms can't be layered on top of each other. However, a fully transformed creature can then be minorly transformed. If that minor transformation is reverted, the creature then returns to their <i>fully transformed</i> state.</dd>\n<dt>Greater Transformation</dt>\n<dd>A greater transformation is even stronger than a full transformation. It can be reverted with a @L[Ability:Self Revert]{Self Revert} (DC 18 @L[Core:INT]{INT} @L[Core:Feat Interaction]{feat save}). Greater transformations immediately change creature's @L[Core:Intelligence]{INT} and maximum @L[Core:MP]{MP} to that of whatever they're transformed into. The original @L[Core:Intelligence]{INT} and maximum @L[Core:MP]{MP} are instantly restored upon reverting from a greater transformation. As with minor and full transformations, greater transformations do not layer on top of each other. However, a full or minor transformation can be layered on top of a greater in the same way that a minor transformation can be layered on a full one.</dd></dl>",
