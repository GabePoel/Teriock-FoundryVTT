If you are @L[Condition:Down]{dropped} with Memory Drain then you forget the hour before you went @L[Condition:Down]{down}. If you are @L[Condition:Dead]{killed} by memory drain, you automatically forget all the events of the day prior to your @L[Condition:Dead]{death}. That is to say that you pull with one additional effective black stone as elves used to. Pulling one black stone will make you lose a level and two will make you PD. You always gain a permanent insanity from memory drain deaths.</p>",
