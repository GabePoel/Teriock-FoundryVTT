  "lethal": "<p>When a creature is reduced to 0 @L[Core:Hit Points and Mana Points]{MP} or below due to lethal drain, it is instead reduced to half their maximum @L[Core:Hit Points and Mana Points]{MP} below zero @L[Core:Hit Points and Mana Points]{MP}. If this is not possible, their @L[Core:Hit Points and Mana Points]{MP} reduces to the lowest value it can go to. This counts as a @L[Category:Killing effects]{killing effect}.\n</p>",
  "mana": "<p>Mana drain is similar to @L[Core:Damage]{damage}, but it reduces @L[Core:MP]{MP} instead of @L[Core:HP]{HP}.\n</p>",
  "memory": "<p><b>Memory drain</b> is identical to @L[Drain:Mana]{mana drain}, but it is not blocked by @L[Property:Silver]{silver}. If you are @L[Condition:Down]{dropped} with Memory Drain then you forget the hour before you went @L[Condition:Down]{down}. If you are @L[Condition:Dead]{killed} by memory drain, you automatically forget all the events of the day prior to your @L[Condition:Dead]{death}. You pull from the @L[Keyword:Death Bag]{death bag} as though you <i>always</i> have one additional black stone. Pulling one black stone will give you a @L[Keyword:Death Bag]{death scar} and two will make you @L[Keyword:Death Bag]{PD}. You always gain a permanent insanity from memory drain deaths determined by the @L[Core:Game Master]{GM}.\n</p>",
