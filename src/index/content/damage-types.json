This condition ends when they are no longer @L[Condition:Down]{down}. Dirtydark damage also leaves lasting long term health consequences that may take years to be observed. If a creature takes dirtydark damage, roll 1d100 each month. If they took N damage, then a roll of N or lower means they develop stage 1 black rot. For every month that passes without black rot developing, the chance of getting it decreases and the number lowers by 1. But the risk of black rot it never goes away entirely. Unless properly treated, a roll of 1 will always lead to black rot, no matter how it's been since the dirtydark damage was taken. If a creature develops black rot, they start to weaken and age rapidly. For every month with black rot, roll 1d100. On a roll of 50 or less, the black rot progresses to the next stage.\n</p>\n<table class=\"wikitable\">\n<caption>Black Rot\n</caption>\n<tbody><tr>\n<th>Stage</th>\n<th>Symptoms\n</th></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Fatigue and shortness of breath.
